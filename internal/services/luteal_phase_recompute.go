	// trade: writing the marker despite a failure would abandon the unrepaired
	// rows silently and forever, while retrying costs one scan per boot. The
	// price is real, though — a row that fails PERMANENTLY (a log row that always
	// errors on read, an update a constraint always refuses) makes every later
	// boot re-list every owner and re-read every owner's logs, before the
	// listener opens, for as long as it stays broken. A count that repeats across
	// boots is the tell, and it is a durable fault to investigate, not a
	// transient one to wait out.

// LutealPhaseRecomputer is the one-shot boot pass that rewrites the derived
// users.luteal_phase cache under the corrected personalized inference.
//
// Why the column needs a pass at all. The inference used to measure the
// calendar span from the observed ovulation date to the next period start,
// which counts the ovulation day itself and so runs one day longer than the
// parameter CalcOvulationDay consumes; an ovulation observed on cycle day 15
// predicted cycle day 14. The computation is fixed, but its result is cached in
// users.luteal_phase, and the two writers that refresh that cache
// (DayService and ImportService, after a day save and after a bulk restore) only
// run when the owner writes something. An account whose logs no longer support
// an inference at all — fewer than three observed cycle starts, or fewer than
// two samples surviving the plausibility filter — reads the stored value through
// resolveUserCycleLengths and keeps the day-early prediction indefinitely.
//
// Why it is not a SQL migration. The correction is not a function of the stored
// number, so no UPDATE over the column can express it, in three separate ways:
//
//  1. 14 is ambiguous. It is the seeded default, the value written whenever the
//     inference declines to refine, AND a plausible old-convention estimate that
//     should now become 13. SQL cannot tell those apart.
//  2. The sample set moves. The plausibility filter (minLutealPhaseDays to
//     maxPlausibleLutealPhaseDays) was applied to the shifted quantity, so a
//     cycle whose corrected sample is 20 was dropped as 21 and now counts, while
//     one whose corrected sample is 9 was kept as 10 and now does not. The
//     average is taken over a different set, not over the same set minus one.
//  3. The refine gate flips. An owner left with fewer than two surviving samples
//     falls back to defaultLutealPhaseDays instead of to a shifted value.
//
// Recomputing means re-running InferUserLutealPhase over the owner's logs, which
// is Go — the same shape as the auth-email pass, which cannot be SQL because
// reducing an RFC 5322 form to its addr-spec requires mail.ParseAddress.
//
// Why it runs at boot rather than from a CLI command. Ovumcy is self-hosted: a
// repair that only happens when the operator remembers to run it leaves exactly
// the accounts this pass exists for — the ones that can no longer self-heal —
// on the old convention forever.
//
// Unlike the two boot passes beside it, a failure here does NOT stop the server.
// The column is a derived cache with a safe fallback (ResolveLutealPhase), and
// its worst stale value is a prediction one day early, so a transient storage
// error must not turn into an instance that will not start. Per-row failures are
// counted and skipped; the marker is written only after a pass in which nothing
// failed, so the next boot retries. Every individual rewrite is idempotent — a
// row already carrying the recomputed value is left alone.
//
// Deleting the app_state row named by AppStateKeyLutealPhaseRecomputeV1 forces
// one more pass on the next boot.
