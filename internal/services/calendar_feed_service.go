// CalendarFeedService resolves a calendar-feed bearer token to its owner and
// renders that owner's read-only .ics body (issue #126-replacement / .ics,
// slice 3). It is the business-logic seam the api layer calls: the api layer
// stays transport-only (it never touches a repository, bcrypt, or the token
// split), and every security decision — constant-time verification,
// timing-equalization against selector enumeration, owner scoping, and
// prediction suppression — lives here.
//
// The token IS the authorization: there is no session, cookie, or user id in
// the request. ResolveFeed splits the token, looks the row up by its non-secret
// selector, constant-time-verifies the secret verifier, and — only on success —
// loads that resolved owner's logs (scoped strictly to the resolved user id) and
// builds the feed. A malformed token, an unknown selector, a wrong verifier, and
// a disabled feed are ALL reported the same way (ok=false, no body), so a caller
// (and thus the HTTP surface) gets no oracle distinguishing them.

// ResolveFeed authenticates a feed token and returns the owner's rendered .ics
// body. ok is false — with no body — for EVERY failure mode (malformed token,
// unknown selector, wrong verifier, disabled feed); the caller maps that single
// outcome to a bare 404, giving no oracle. err is non-nil only for an
// infrastructure failure (a DB or log-read error), which the caller maps to a
// generic 500 — never a body that distinguishes it from the 404 path in a way
// that leaks token state.
//
// location is the FALLBACK zone only: the resolved owner's persisted timezone
// decides which calendar day the feed renders, and the caller's location is used
// only when that column is empty or unusable (see the resolution comment below).
//
// Timing-equalization (mirrors equalizeAuthCredentialsTiming): the verify path
// pays exactly one keyed-MAC compare inside VerifyCalendarFeedToken. The
// selector-miss path would otherwise short-circuit before any verifier work and
// leak — through response latency — that no row bears the presented selector
// (CWE-208). So on a selector miss the service performs one dummy MAC compare
// against a fixed placeholder, matching the verify path's single compare and
// leaving no timing signal that separates "unknown selector" from "known
// selector, wrong verifier". A malformed token (wrong length) is rejected before
// any lookup and is not timing-sensitive: it reveals nothing about which
// selectors exist.
//
// The equalization must track whatever primitive the verify path actually runs,
// or it stops equalizing anything. That is why it moved off bcrypt in lockstep
// with the verifier: a MAC-based verify path paired with a bcrypt-based dummy
// would have kept the exact CPU cost this design removes — every random token
// would still burn ~265 ms on the miss path — while a bcrypt verify path paired
// with a MAC-based dummy would hand back the enumeration oracle.
//
// ONE transitional exception, bounded and self-healing: a row minted before
// migration 032 has no MAC, so verifying it costs one bcrypt. Until its first
// successful poll writes the MAC in, that row's wrong-verifier latency is
// distinguishable from a selector miss. Reaching that signal requires already
// holding a valid 80-bit selector (a leaked subscribe URL carries both halves, so
// there is no realistic path to the selector alone), and the feed's own per-IP
// budget caps the attempt rate. Documented in SECURITY.md and
// docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md rather than papered over.
