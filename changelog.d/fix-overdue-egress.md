### Fixed

- **Reminders and calendar events stopped inventing dates for a cycle that had not started.** Once a
  cycle runs past the account's reference length by more than a week, the projection can only roll a
  whole cycle forward at a time — and three surfaces kept following it. The webhook reminder
  announced a "period soon" for a date nothing in the account supported, and because its
  already-sent marker is the predicted date itself, every roll re-armed a new one, repeating about
  once per cycle for as long as the cycle stayed open. The `.ics` feed pushed up to three cycles of
  invented period and ovulation events into subscribed calendar clients, where they outlive any
  correction made in the app. The calendar grid shaded a predicted period in the past — on days that
  came and went with no period logged — and phantom fertile windows ahead of it. All three now stop
  projecting for an overdue cycle, exactly as the dashboard already does; a temperature-confirmed
  ovulation day is recorded rather than projected, and the grid and the feed keep showing it as the
  dashboard does. Logged days, their markers and
  the calendar subscription itself are untouched. When the new cycle start is finally logged, the
  next reminder fires once, on time.
