# The builder tag must stay equal to the toolchain go.mod asks for — its
# `toolchain` directive where there is one, otherwise the `go` line, which is
# the order actions/setup-go reads them in. Every CI Go job resolves its
# toolchain with `go-version-file: go.mod`, so a builder ahead of that directive
# ships a binary compiled by a toolchain no unit, race or e2e run ever
# exercised — GOTOOLCHAIN only ever upgrades, never downgrades, so the newer
# image simply wins. A release candidate reached this line that way. CI
# now asserts the equality (`Builder toolchain matches go.mod` in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml), and Dependabot is told to leave pre-release tags of
# this image alone.

# The two packages are pinned to the revision the v3.24 main repository carried
# when this line was last bumped, so a rebuild of one commit installs the same
# files. Alpine keeps only the CURRENT revision of a package in a branch, so a
# pin goes stale as soon as the branch publishes a newer one and the build then
# fails with "no such package" until the pin is bumped: read the new revisions
# from the v3.24 main APKINDEX (the `V:` line under `P:tzdata` and
# `P:ca-certificates`) or from `apk policy` inside the pinned alpine image, and
# bump both together with the base image digest above. The runtime stage is
# `scratch` and carries no package database, so the image scan cannot report
# these two packages' versions; the pin is the only record of them.
