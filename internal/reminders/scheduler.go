// Package reminders holds the trigger for the built-in daily reminder scheduler
// (issue #125). It is a thin, lifecycle-tied wrapper around the request-free
// webhook notify pass (issue #124): the pass itself — listing owners, deciding
// due reminders, delivering, and writing each per-reminder watermark — is
// unchanged and remains the authoritative idempotency guard. This package adds
// ONLY the trigger: when to call the pass, a once-per-local-day "ran today"
// marker for restart safety and current-day catch-up, a bounded retry when a
// pass fails outright (so a transient failure costs minutes, not the whole
// day), panic isolation so a bad pass cannot crash the web process, and a
// bounded drain on shutdown.
//
// Why here and not in cmd/ovumcy: keeping the schedule math (nextRun),
// catch-up, marker handling, and drain in an internal package makes them fully
// unit-testable with an injected clock and stubs — cmd/ovumcy is the codecov-
// ignored composition root and only supplies ~3 lines of glue.
//
// Concurrency contract (this is the first long-lived, request-path-adjacent
// goroutine in the codebase): a Scheduler.Run runs in exactly ONE goroutine.
// The "ran today" marker is read and written only by that goroutine, so it needs
// no Go-level locking. The Scheduler captures only value config, the PassRunner
// and MarkerStore interfaces (built once at boot), and a clock — it shares NO
// mutable Go state with the HTTP handlers. The underlying DB handle is the
// concurrency-safe *gorm.DB the rest of the process already shares. The
// scheduler never touches the fiber app, the server's `served` channel, or app
// shutdown; it only reads its clock/timer, calls RunOnce, and selects on the
// signal context — so it cannot participate in the fiber/fasthttp boot-window
// shutdown race (#146/#147/#165).

// passRetryDelay, up to maxPassAttempts attempts in this slot. Marking the day
// after the LAST failed attempt is what keeps the original anti-busy-loop
// property: a broken database costs a bounded number of attempts, then the
// scheduler waits for the next scheduled fire rather than spinning. #124's

// against the moment it actually runs. The MARKED day is not that clock: it is

// hour, so a late-evening start can spend its whole budget past midnight — and
// marking the last attempt's day would then close TOMORROW, a day whose pass has
