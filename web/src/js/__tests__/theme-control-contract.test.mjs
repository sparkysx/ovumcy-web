// The theme control moved once already: a header toggle bound to
// `[data-theme-option]` was replaced by the settings-interface radiogroup bound
// to `[data-settings-interface-theme-option]`. The template half of the move
// landed; the JS half did not, and the orphaned binder kept running on every
// page for as long as nobody grepped for its selector.
//
// This guard is scoped to that one pair of hooks on purpose. It pins both
// directions of the move: the retired selector must not reappear in any client
// source, and the surviving selector must still be the one the settings panel
// renders and the one the bundle queries. A dead binder is silent by nature —
// it costs a querySelectorAll per init and reports nothing — so the only thing
// that can notice it is a check that names the selector.
