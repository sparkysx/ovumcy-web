# Data Export Format

Ovumcy supports three export endpoints under `Settings → Export`:

- `POST /api/export/json` — full per-day records as JSON.
- `POST /api/export/csv` — full per-day records as CSV.
- `POST /api/export/summary` — small JSON summary used by the Settings UI.

All three accept an optional date range as form fields `from` and `to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, in the user's timezone). Omitting them exports everything.

Each export endpoint requires the `owner` role and a valid auth session. CSRF token is required for browser submissions.

## JSON Export

```http
POST /api/export/json
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: ovumcy_auth=...; ovumcy_csrf=...

csrf_token=...&from=2026-01-01&to=2026-05-31
```

Response headers: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ovumcy-export-<timestamp>.json"`, `Content-Type: application/json`.

Response body:

```json
{
  "exported_at": "2026-05-17T14:32:01+03:00",
  "entries": [
    {
      "date": "2026-05-17",
      "period": true,
      "flow": "medium",
      "mood_rating": 3,
      "sex_activity": "protected",
      "bbt": 36.7,
      "cervical_mucus": "creamy",
      "cycle_factors": ["stress", "travel"],
      "symptoms": {
        "cramps": true,
        "headache": false,
        "acne": false,
        "mood": false,
        "bloating": true,
        "fatigue": true,
        "breast_tenderness": false,
        "back_pain": false,
        "nausea": false,
        "spotting": false,
        "irritability": false,
        "insomnia": false,
        "food_cravings": false,
        "diarrhea": false,
        "constipation": false
      },
      "other_symptoms": ["my-custom-symptom"],
      "notes": "felt tired all afternoon"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exported_at` | RFC 3339 string | Server time at export, in the user's timezone. |
| `entries` | array | One entry per logged day. Days with no data are not exported. |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` string | Calendar day in the user's timezone. |
| `period` | boolean | Whether the day is marked as a period day. |
| `flow` | string | One of `none`, `spotting`, `light`, `medium`, `heavy`. |
| `mood_rating` | integer | User-selected mood scale. Zero means unset. |
| `sex_activity` | string | One of `none`, `protected`, `unprotected`. |
| `bbt` | float | Basal body temperature in the unit selected per account (°C or °F). Zero means unset. |
| `cervical_mucus` | string | One of `none`, `dry`, `moist`, `creamy`, `eggwhite`. |
| `cycle_factors` | array of strings | Free-form factor keys recorded that day (e.g. `stress`, `travel`, `illness`). |
| `symptoms` | object of booleans | Flags for the 15 built-in symptoms. Always present, even when all false. |
| `other_symptoms` | array of strings | Names of owner-managed custom symptoms recorded that day. |
| `notes` | string | Free-text note. |

The `symptoms` object always contains the same 15 keys, in this order: `cramps`, `headache`, `acne`, `mood`, `bloating`, `fatigue`, `breast_tenderness`, `back_pain`, `nausea`, `spotting`, `irritability`, `insomnia`, `food_cravings`, `diarrhea`, `constipation`. Any other symptom configured by the owner appears in `other_symptoms` as a free-text name.

## CSV Export

```http
POST /api/export/csv
```

Response headers: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="ovumcy-export-<timestamp>.csv"`, `Content-Type: text/csv`.

Columns (in order, single header row):

```
Date, Period, Flow, Mood rating, Sex activity, BBT (C), Cervical mucus,
Cramps, Headache, Acne, Mood, Bloating, Fatigue, Breast tenderness,
Back pain, Nausea, Spotting, Irritability, Insomnia, Food cravings,
Diarrhea, Constipation, Cycle factors, Other, Notes
```

Cell semantics:

- `Date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` in the user's timezone.
- `Period`, and the 15 symptom columns, are `true`/`false`.
- `Flow`, `Sex activity`, `Cervical mucus` carry the same string vocabulary as the JSON export.
- `BBT (C)` is the float value in the unit selected on the account; the header keeps the literal text `BBT (C)` for stability and does not change to `BBT (F)` for Fahrenheit accounts. Operators reading the file should consult the account's `temperature_unit` setting (or the source UI) to interpret the unit.
- `Cycle factors` is a `;`-separated list of factor keys; empty when none were recorded.
- `Other` is a `;`-separated list of owner-managed custom symptom names; empty when none.
- `Notes` is the free-text note; the CSV writer quotes the cell as needed.

## Summary Export

```http
POST /api/export/summary
```

Response is JSON (not a file download), used by the Settings UI before showing the full export buttons:

```json
{
  "total_entries": 142,
  "has_data": true,
  "date_from": "2025-09-01",
  "date_to": "2026-05-17"
}
```

`date_from`/`date_to` are absent or empty strings when the range is unbounded.

## Stability

The JSON entry shape and CSV columns are stable across Ovumcy patch and minor releases. Breaking changes (renaming or removing a field, changing the value vocabulary, reordering CSV columns) ship in a major release with a migration note in `CHANGELOG.md`. Adding a new field to the JSON entry or a new column at the end of the CSV is non-breaking and does not trigger a major bump.

The wrapping JSON shape (`exported_at` / `entries`) follows the same rule.
