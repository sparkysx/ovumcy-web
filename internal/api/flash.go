// exemptFlashCookieSpec is the second flash channel (WEB-40): a write reached
// through a request the CSRF middleware never validates — the OIDC callback's
// sole exemption and its unguarded query-mode GET twin (handlers_auth_oidc.go,
// StartOIDCLogin/CompleteOIDCLogin), the step-up cross-site refusal that runs
// on that same request (refuseOIDCStepupCallback's cross-site arm,
// oidc_stepup_continuation.go), the requireFirstPartyRequest refusals that
// themselves fire on the cross-site request the guard exists to name
// (refuseOIDCStepupContinueRequest, refuseRegisterPickupRequest), and every
// rate limiter in cmd/ovumcy/server.go whose refusal reaches an auth-form or
// settings-form target (RespondAuthRateLimited/RespondAPIRateLimited →
// respondRateLimitedFormError → respondAuthErrorCSRFExempt /
// respondSettingsErrorCSRFExempt, error_mapping_rate_limit.go,
// error_mapping_transport.go): every limiter.Config is mounted ahead of
// csrf.New, so a cross-site, token-less flood can trip any of them — login,
// register, forgot-password, SSO, logout, and the /api catch-all that also
// answers the settings and other auth-form paths — not just the SSO one round
// 4 named. Round 5 additionally drops the forgot-password email from this
// channel: a request that trips a limiter supplied that value itself, so
// echoing it back is not a prefill, it is reflecting attacker input — seal
// into THIS cookie via setCSRFExemptFlashCookie, never flashCookieSpec's.
// Because it is a separate cookie, a token-less writer structurally cannot
// overwrite or erase flashCookieName's value: it never sends a Set-Cookie for
// that name at all. See popFlashCookie for the read-side precedence between
// the two.
//
// A THIRD group cannot be sorted at compile time: requireFirstPartyRequest is
// deliberately monotone (see firstPartyRequestRefusal) and lets through a
// stated "same-site" origin and a missing Fetch Metadata family, neither of
// which is evidence of a same-origin request. ContinueOIDCStepup's
// no-continuation arm, refuseOIDCStepupCallback's same-site arm, and
// PickupRegister's redirectToPostRegisterSignin all defer their slot choice
// to setFlashCookieForRequestOrigin, which picks the page slot only for a
// STATED "same-origin" Sec-Fetch-Site (WEB-40 round 3).
//
// Every OTHER setFlashCookie call site sits behind session + CSRF (the
// authenticated settings routes) or a step-up whose dispatch already matched
// the sealed state secret (the per-purpose completions the direct same-site
// callback shares with ContinueOIDCStepup's successful leg) — none of those is
// reachable by a request carrying no token from another site, so they keep
// using setFlashCookie/flashCookieSpec unchanged.

// missing entirely all satisfy that guard (it is deliberately monotone — see
// firstPartyRequestRefusal) but none of them is evidence the request is the
// app's own document, the same standard callbackArrivedCrossSite already
// applies for the OIDC bounce. So the page slot is reserved for the one value
// that IS such evidence — a STATED "same-origin" — and every other case,
// including silence, goes to the exempt slot. This mirrors
// callbackArrivedCrossSite's monotone reasoning rather than negating it: that
// helper still decides "is this cross-site" for the bounce; this one decides
// "is this provably same-origin" for the flash slot, and the two disagree on
// purpose for "same-site" and "missing", which the bounce runs through
// unchanged (state-secret gated) but the flash slot must not.

// popFlashCookie applies the precedence the WEB-40 decision names: the page
// slot (flashCookieName) wins whenever it carries anything — it is the
// trusted, same-origin channel every ordinary page redirect writes, and a
// token-less writer must never outrank it. The page slot is always read and
// cleared (its existing single-use contract). When the page slot wins, the
// exempt slot is retracted too rather than left standing: a stale
// token-less message left riding would otherwise surface on a later,
// unrelated render, once the page slot that outranked it has been consumed
// and is no longer there to keep outranking it. The exempt slot is read
// (and, on its own, cleared) only when the page slot was EMPTY, which is the
// ordinary case — a genuine provider refusal with nothing else pending.
//
// Known accepted gap (F4, round 3): "wins" is decided on flashPayloadEmpty,
// not on whether the rendering page actually shows one of the page slot's
// fields. buildSettingsViewData reads only SettingsError/SettingsSuccess and
// the auth pages read only AuthError/ForgotEmail (see redirectSettingsRefusal
// and respondAuthError), so a page slot minted for one page kind (e.g. an
// AuthError meant for /login) that a request instead pops from the OTHER page
// kind (/settings) is popped, discarded unrendered, AND still outranks and
// clears a genuinely pending exempt message — losing both. This needs two
// flashes racing across tabs/page-kinds within the 5-minute TTL, is not
// reachable by a token-less writer (every page-slot writer is either
// session+CSRF-gated or state-secret/origin-gated after F1/F2 above), and is
// left as a documented gap rather than threaded through with a per-page field
// predicate no other call site needs.
