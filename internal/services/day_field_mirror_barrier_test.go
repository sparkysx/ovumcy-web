// Barrier for the two mirrored day-field predicates.
//
// DayHasData asks whether a day carries any signal at all;
// IsAutoFilledPeriodCandidate asks whether a period day carries nothing BUT the
// auto-filled period marks, so toggling the anchor off may clear it. The second
// question is the first one inverted, and the two functions answer it by
// testing the same DailyLog fields in the same order with opposite returns.
//
// Nothing held them together. Both had their own per-function test table, and a
// ninth field wired into DayHasData alone would leave
// ClearAutoFilledPeriodNeighbors deleting a day that carries that manual signal
// — a silent loss of what the owner typed, which is the consequence this
// barrier exists to prevent.
//
// It reads the shipped source of both functions rather than a list of fields
// kept here, so a field added later is covered the moment it is written. The
// two exception sets below are the only asymmetry the source is allowed to
// carry, and each is documented at its function.
