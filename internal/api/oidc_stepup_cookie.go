// follows. Nothing that reaches one of those arms can be a live step-up:
// setOIDCStepupCookie mints no payload that is incomplete for its purpose, and

// is re-sent to the callback path by every later request, and this cookie is

// because the reader is the only place that knows a value was presented and
// found unusable; a caller sees an empty state and would have to repeat the
// clear, and the next caller added without it reintroduces the leak. A missing
// cookie retracts nothing: there is no value to retract, and an empty value is
