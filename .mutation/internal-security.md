# Mutation baseline — `internal/security`

Authoritative gremlins run for the auth/crypto/OIDC package (reproduce with
`scripts/mutation.sh baseline`); this file is the reviewed summary.

## v1.8.x exhaustive verification (2026-07-12)

Every survivor in the v1.8.0 baseline (`workflow_dispatch` run
[29168889008](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/29168889008) on
tag `v1.8.0`, `internal_security`: 142 mutants, 118 killed, 8 lived, 16 not
covered) was verified per-mutant on branch `test/mutation-hardening` — the exact
gremlins mutation applied to the source, a **deliberately broad** covering test
set run (not gremlins' coverage-guided subset), then reverted. Production `.go`
is unchanged (tests only).

**Why the raw survivor list over-reports:** Go emits no coverage counter on
`const`/`case` lines (they show NOT_COVERED regardless of tests), and gremlins'
coverage-guided selection can run an incomplete test subset for such lines, so a
mutant an existing test *does* kill still shows LIVED. Most `oidc.go` survivors
were already-killed by existing tests; the genuine gaps below are now pinned
(`oidc_mutkill_test.go`, plus a `serveToken` mock-IdP path in
`oidc_runtime_poc_test.go`):

- provider memoization guard (L416), `DefaultTransport` clone (L659), custom-CA
  add to system roots (L668), `AuthCodeURL` blank-extra-key skip (L331);
- the full `ExchangeCode` verify/guard chain (L345–L373), the **nonce-mismatch
  reject** (L363), and the `iat`/`auth_time` zero-vs-present boundaries (L378/L382).

Residual survivors are documented equivalents (e.g. the L278 trailing-`@`
index-bounded guard) or `const`-line attribution artifacts (the 10s outbound
timeout, pinned behaviorally by `TestOIDCHTTPClientTimeoutIsBounded`). No
suspected bugs.

**Post-hardening re-measure.** A fresh clean-Linux run on the `test/mutation-hardening` branch ([29192052605](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/29192052605)) confirms the closed gaps: `internal_security` **97.8%** (134 killed / 3 lived, 5 not covered), up from 93.7% at the v1.8.0 baseline. Current canonical figure (mirrored in `TESTING.md`); the dated `## Score` sections below are prior runs, kept as history.

## Score (measured on the `mutation/shard-services-and-kills` branch)

**Source: workflow_dispatch run
[28837779621](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/28837779621)**
on `mutation.yml` (`mutation-baseline (internal_security)` job, single unsharded
run, green), dispatched from the branch at commit `829d568`, which adds the
`validateOIDCCABundle` kill (below). Supersedes the prior `28758365493` /
`a6d7e41` measurement (112 killed / 9 lived / 92.56%). Numbers confirmed two
independent ways: (a) gremlins' own end-of-run summary line in the job log,
(b) counting `"status"` values directly in the downloaded
`internal_security.json`. Both agree exactly.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Killed | 113 |
| Lived (survivors) | 8 — documented below (equivalent or e2e/host-covered) |
| Timed out | 0 |
| Not covered | 17 |
| **Test efficacy** | **93.39%** — killed / (killed + lived) = 113 / 121 |
| Mutator coverage | 87.68% — (killed + lived) / (killed + lived + not covered) = 121 / 138 |

`oidc.go:613` moved from the survivor list into `Killed` this run: a prior pass
had filed it as equivalent on the strength of the unreadable-file case alone,
but a **readable** `OIDC_CA_FILE` carrying no PEM certificate is *accepted* under
the `err == nil` mutant (it returns the nil read-error early, skipping the
`AppendCertsFromPEM` rejection) while the real code rejects it. The gap is now
closed by `TestValidateOIDCCABundleRejectsBundleWithoutCertificate`
(`oidc_mutation_coverage_test.go`), verified per-mutant.

The OIDC client's provider-facing code (discovery, code exchange, token
verification, TLS bootstrap) is exercised by the end-to-end OIDC lanes
(Playwright, three browsers), not by Go unit tests — mutation runs only
`go test`, so those lines survive or show "not covered" here while being covered
at the e2e layer.

## Documented survivors of run `28837779621` — history

**Superseded, kept for the reasoning.** The canonical state is the post-hardening
re-measure above — **97.8%**, 3 lived — so the eight below are that run's survivor
set, not a current count, and their line numbers track `oidc.go` as it stood then.

The 8 mutants below survived run `28837779621`. Relative to the prior
`28758365493` set, `oidc.go:613` was **killed** this round (re-triaged from
equivalent to a real gap — see the score note above); the rest carry the same
argument as before (equivalent, or reachable only through the e2e OIDC lanes,
not `go test`).

### Equivalent mutants

**`sealed_cipher.go:115` — AEAD payload-length guard (BOUNDARY).**
`len(payload) <= nonceSize` → `< nonceSize`. At `len == nonceSize` the mutant
proceeds with an empty ciphertext; AES-256-GCM `Open` then fails authentication
(ciphertext shorter than the 16-byte tag) and returns an error with nil
plaintext — the same observable outcome as the explicit "payload too short"
rejection. No plaintext is produced; only the error text differs.

**`oidc.go:260:51` — trailing-`@` guard in AllowsAutoProvision (ARITHMETIC, INVERT).**
`atIndex == len(email)-1` rejects an address ending in `@`. Removing/inverting it
lets the code proceed, but it extracts an empty domain that matches no allowed
domain and returns `false` anyway. (The `atIndex < 0` half is a real boundary,
killed by a test.)

**`oidc.go:629:15` — defensive transport nil-check (NEGATION).**
`http.DefaultTransport` is always a non-nil `*http.Transport`, so the guarded
branch is unreachable in practice; both branches yield a functional client.

### Covered by the e2e OIDC lanes / host environment

**`oidc.go:390:24`, `oidc.go:390:50` — provider cache fast-path (NEGATION).**
Reaching the cached branch needs a previously discovered provider (live issuer +
JWKS). The e2e lanes drive repeated authorize/exchange calls that reuse it; a Go
unit cannot build a real verifier without a provider.

**`oidc.go:638:15`, `oidc.go:638:31` — system cert-pool fallback (NEGATION).**
The `SystemCertPool` failure branch cannot be forced from a test on a normally
configured host; the success path is taken and the mutants do not change the
resulting (functional) client observably.

## Not covered

12 of the 17 not-covered mutants are the provider-facing OIDC methods
`AuthCodeURL` (line 290) and `ExchangeCode` (line 313), spanning lines
295–356, which need a live provider and are driven by the e2e OIDC lanes. 1 is
the package-level `const defaultOIDCHTTPTimeout = 10 * time.Second` (line 21),
which Go statement coverage never instruments — both as previously documented,
just at a shifted line range.

The remaining 4 are new since the last measurement: `OIDCConfig.validateRequiredFields`'s
switch-case branches (`oidc.go:144,146,148,150`) that reject a missing
`OIDC_ISSUER_URL`/`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`/`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`/`OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`.
This validation runs once at bootstrap with a fixed, operator-supplied config —
not exercised by a `go test` unit today. Whether that's an acceptable gap (config
validation is arguably an integration/bootstrap concern) or worth a small
table-driven unit test is a call for the next triage pass, not asserted here.
