// TestOIDCSignInWritesALogoutStateAccountErasureCanReach is the write half of
// the logout-state owner boundary. Reading is scoped to the session's owner,
// which only helps if the row carries one: a state built without its owner is
// persisted with user_id = 0, and account erasure — which deletes these rows
// with WHERE user_id = ? — can never match it, leaving a raw id_token_hint
// behind for up to the seven-day TTL after the account is gone. Migration 033
// purged the rows that predate the column so the table could hold that
// guarantee; a writer that mints an unattributed row breaks it again.
//
// The provider stays a double — only the code exchange is replaced. What is
// real here is the resolution of the account, the row that gets written, and
// the erasure that has to reach it.
