// Cross-site step-up continuation.
//
// A provider on another registrable site returns the authorization code as a
// form_post, so the callback arrives as a CROSS-SITE POST. The step-up cookies
// are SameSite=None and reach it, but the session cookie is SameSite=Lax and
// does not: Lax withholds cookies on a cross-site POST. Every step-up purpose
// resolves the owner from that session (a request-carried user id is never
// trusted alone), so the callback cannot tell who is completing the action and
// refuses — the R2 failure.
//
// The bounce fixes that without widening any cookie's reach. The cross-site
// POST validates the sealed state, parks what it learned in a single-use
// continuation cookie, and 303s to a same-origin GET. A top-level GET
// navigation is exactly what SameSite=Lax permits, so the session cookie
// arrives there and the completion runs with the owner identified as before.
// The continuation itself stays Lax for the same reason — it only ever has to
// survive that one navigation — and is Secure, HttpOnly, path-scoped to the
// continue route, one-time, and valid for a minute.
