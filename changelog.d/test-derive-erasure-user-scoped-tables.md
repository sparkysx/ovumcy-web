Test-only. The account-erasure completeness test no longer carries a
hand-written list of the five user-scoped tables — a list that mirrored
`DeleteAccountAndRelatedData` and so could only ever agree with it. It now
derives the tables from the live schema through GORM's migrator (every table
carrying a `user_id` column), requires the fixture to have seeded each of them
before the erasure, and asserts each is empty for the deleted account
afterwards. Because the migration sets are per dialect, the scenario runs once
per engine: SQLite always, Postgres behind the shared docker-gated container
helper. Production behaviour is unchanged: the five tables the code erases
today are exactly the five the derivation finds. What changes is that a later
migration adding a user-scoped table without a matching delete now turns the
test red instead of staying green.
