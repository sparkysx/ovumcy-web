### Security

- **The single sign-on page must now belong to the configured provider.** Ovumcy already refused
  a provider whose discovery document placed the token and key endpoints on another host, but it
  still followed the sign-in page address wherever that document pointed — so a tampered document
  could send the browser, with the sign-in request attached, to a look-alike page on a host the
  provider does not own. The sign-in page is now held to the same rule: same scheme, host and port
  as `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, or single sign-on stays unavailable. A provider whose sign-in page lives on
  a separate host needs `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` pointed at an issuer whose endpoints share its origin.
  The provider sign-out address saved for a session is checked against the configured issuer again
  before the browser is sent there, so after the issuer's origin (scheme, host or port) changes,
  signing out of an older session is local only. The address the provider returns the browser to
  after sign-out is now always the one configured now, never the one saved with the session.

- **An OIDC address written in non-ASCII characters is refused.** A host such as the full-width
  `０.０.０.０` passed the "must name a remote host" check, yet HTTP clients and browsers convert
  it to `0.0.0.0` before connecting. Any host containing a non-ASCII character is now rejected; an
  internationalized domain keeps working in its ASCII `xn--` form.

  **Upgrade note:** if `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` or `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`
  names an internationalized domain in its Unicode spelling (for example `https://idp.bücher.de`),
  Ovumcy now refuses to start with "host must be ASCII". Replace the host with its `xn--` form
  (`https://idp.xn--bcher-kva.de`) — the same address, in the spelling clients already connect to.
