# Password & Auth Policy, Rate Limits

_Part of the [Ovumcy security policy](../../SECURITY.md)._

## Password & Auth Policy

**Local passwords:**

- Minimum length: 8 Unicode code points.
- Maximum length: 72 bytes — bcrypt's hard input limit. Longer submissions fail validation with the same stable weak-password error on every password-accepting flow instead of surfacing bcrypt's opaque hashing error.
- Required character classes: at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit (`ValidatePasswordStrength` in `internal/services/password_policy.go`).
- Storage: bcrypt at cost 12 (the `passwordHashCost` constant in `internal/services`, above the library `bcrypt.DefaultCost` of 10) via `golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt`. Hashes live in `users.password_hash`. A successful login whose stored hash predates this floor is opportunistically re-hashed at cost 12 in place (`UpgradePasswordHashCAS`), so the effective cost rises for existing accounts without forcing a reset; this transparent upgrade does **not** bump `auth_session_version` (the credential is unchanged). The write applies only while `password_hash` still holds the hash the login verified, so a password change or reset that lands during the login wins over it.

**Recovery codes:**

- Shape: `OVUM-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`, 12 characters drawn uniformly via `crypto/rand` from a 32-symbol Crockford-style base32 alphabet (`A`–`Z` without `I`/`O`, digits `2`–`9`) — 60 bits of effective entropy (`GenerateRecoveryCode`, `internal/services/auth_reset_policy.go`).
- Storage: bcrypt-hashed in `users.recovery_code_hash`. The plaintext is shown to the user exactly once at issuance and is never retrievable server-side afterwards.
- Online guessing is bounded by the per-account rate limiter (`Rate Limits`, below); the code's 60 bits of entropy and the bcrypt cost bound offline guessing if the database leaks. Recovery-code hashing involves no `SECRET_KEY` — `GenerateRecoveryCodeHash` is plain bcrypt and verification is a direct compare against `users.recovery_code_hash` — so a database leak **on its own** already permits offline candidate testing; treat any database compromise as a reason to regenerate outstanding recovery codes.

**Session tokens:**

- `ovumcy_auth` payload is sealed (AES-256-GCM under an HKDF-derived key, see *Cookies* in [docs/security/cryptography.md](cryptography.md#cookies)) and verified per request against `users.auth_session_version`.
- Issued by `setAuthCookie`; reissued inline on the originating device whenever `auth_session_version` is bumped (see *Session Invalidation on Credential Rotation* in [docs/security/oidc-and-sessions.md](oidc-and-sessions.md#session-invalidation-on-credential-rotation)).

**TOTP 2FA:**

- RFC 6238 with a 30-second step.
- Secrets are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest with per-row AAD binding (see *Field-Level Encryption* in [docs/security/cryptography.md](cryptography.md#field-level-encryption)).
- Replay protection: `users.totp_last_used_step` carries the RFC 6238 step index of the last successfully consumed code. `ClaimTOTPStep` performs an atomic `UPDATE … WHERE totp_last_used_step < ?`,
  so the same code cannot be consumed twice and concurrent submissions of the same step collapse to a single winner. The code that confirms an enrollment counts as consumed too: the write that
  enables 2FA stores the step it matched as `totp_last_used_step`, so that code cannot also pass the first sign-in challenge. An enable call that carries no verified step
  is refused before anything is written. Disabling 2FA resets the column to 0 together with the secret.

## Rate Limits

Per-IP HTTP rate limits enforced by Fiber's limiter middleware. Defaults are tunable through environment variables:

| Endpoint | Default budget | Env override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions` | 8 requests / 15 minutes | `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_WINDOW` |
| `POST /api/v1/users` | 8 requests / 15 minutes | `RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_REGISTER_WINDOW` |
| `POST /api/v1/password-resets` | 8 requests / 1 hour | `RATE_LIMIT_FORGOT_PASSWORD_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_FORGOT_PASSWORD_WINDOW` |
| `POST /api/v1/sessions/2fa-challenge` | 8 requests / 15 minutes | `RATE_LIMIT_TOTP_CHALLENGE_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_TOTP_CHALLENGE_WINDOW` |
| `POST /api/v1/password-resets/redeem` | 8 requests / 15 minutes | `RATE_LIMIT_PASSWORD_RESET_REDEEM_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_PASSWORD_RESET_REDEEM_WINDOW` |
| `/auth/oidc/*` (OIDC sign-in) | 8 requests / 15 minutes | shares `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_WINDOW` |
| `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/current` | 60 requests / 15 minutes | `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_WINDOW` |
| `POST /lang` (language switch) | 300 requests / 1 minute | shares `RATE_LIMIT_API_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_API_WINDOW` |
| `/api/*` (catch-all) | 300 requests / 1 minute | `RATE_LIMIT_API_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_API_WINDOW` |
| `GET/HEAD /calendar/feed/:token.ics` | 20 requests / 1 minute | `RATE_LIMIT_CALENDAR_FEED_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_CALENDAR_FEED_WINDOW` |
| `GET/HEAD /calendar` | 300 requests / 1 minute | `RATE_LIMIT_CALENDAR_MAX`, `RATE_LIMIT_CALENDAR_WINDOW` |

Every setting above has a ceiling as well as a floor (`cmd/ovumcy/config.go`): a `*_MAX` may not
exceed 100 on the five credential endpoints (login and register each cost a bcrypt compare or
hash; the 2FA challenge and the password-reset redeem cost none, or one only after their token
check accepts — see below), 600
on the per-IP logout row, 200 on the per-account logout budget, 3000 on the API catch-all, 3000
on the calendar page and 120 on the calendar feed, and a `*_WINDOW` must lie between one second
and one day. A value
outside its range is logged at boot and replaced by the default, so a misread unit or a stray
zero cannot widen a budget past its ceiling, let alone switch a limiter off. On the five
credential endpoints the window floor is one minute instead, and a refused `*_WINDOW` (below it,
above a day, unparseable) is logged at boot and BOTH halves fall back to their defaults, as for a
pair above the rate below. On those
five endpoints the pair is also held to a rate: at most 30 requests per minute, checked in
integers as `MAX × 1 minute ≤ 30 × WINDOW`, so `100` over `200s` is the widest a count of 100 may
run and a shorter window no longer widens the budget. A pair above that rate is logged at boot and
BOTH halves fall back to their defaults. On login, register and forgot-password the ceilings bound
the *rate* of bcrypt work an address can demand — at most about half a compare a second; the
bcrypt cost itself (12) is the load-bearing limit and is not lowered to compensate. The 2FA
challenge and the password-reset redeem carry the same ceiling as defence-in-depth against
credential guessing (TOTP codes; reset tokens) even though neither pays that CPU cost on every
request.

A single-endpoint row above is matched the way the router matches, not by raw path bytes: routing is case-insensitive and ignores trailing slashes, so `POST /LANG` and `POST /lang/` reach the same handler as `POST /lang` and draw on the same budget. The match stays exact rather than prefix-wide — `POST /api/v1/sessions/2fa-challenge` does not spend the sign-in row's budget; it draws on its own row above (WEB-70) and on its own per-account TOTP budget below; it checks a TOTP code and pays no bcrypt. `POST /api/v1/password-resets/redeem` likewise draws on its own row above rather than the `/api` catch-all — it first runs `ResolveUserByResetToken` (an HMAC JWT parse plus fingerprint and session-version checks) and only a request carrying a valid token reaches `ResetPasswordAndRotateRecoveryCodeCAS`, where the new password is hashed; a request with no valid token pays no bcrypt at all. Neither route has a service-level attempt budget behind it, so the edge ceiling is the only bound on guessing TOTP codes or reset tokens against it.

A HEAD request to the feed both counts against this budget and is answered by the feed: `RegisterRoutes` gives every GET route a HEAD route with the same handler chain, registered ahead of the terminal `NotFound` catch-all, so HEAD reaches `ServeCalendarFeed` and returns its status and headers with the body dropped on the wire. It used to reach the catch-all's 404 instead — fiber appends a GET route's auto-generated HEAD copy only at startup, behind every directly-registered `Use` middleware — which is why the row above once distinguished "rate-limited" from "answers the feed". A calendar client that probes with HEAD before fetching therefore spends two of the twenty, one per request.

Every one of them refuses in the application's own error format. A client that asked for JSON receives the shared envelope — `error` with the endpoint's stable key (`too_many_login_attempts` and its siblings), `error_detail` with the category and target — plus `retry_after_seconds`, an extension member echoing the `Retry-After` header, so it inherits that header's bound of whole seconds no larger than the configured window. A browser is answered as the flow needs: the auth and settings forms redirect back to the form with a flash, and the language switch — the only public form with no HTMX behind it — renders the localized status fragment, because a full-page navigation cannot display a JSON body. The `.ics` feed has no page, so it answers the envelope.

The calendar feed deliberately does **not** share the `/api/*` budget. When the budget was introduced it was the only unauthenticated endpoint paying a bcrypt compare on every well-formed request — the verifier check on a selector hit, or the timing-equalization dummy on a selector miss — so at the `/api` budget a single IP could spend 300 bcrypts per minute without any credential. Migration 032 moved verification to a keyed MAC (microseconds), which removed that CPU cliff for every row minted since; a row minted before it still pays one bcrypt until its first successful poll writes its MAC in.

Keep the separate budget and keep it small anyway. It bounds the residual bcrypt of not-yet-migrated rows, and it is the only limit on a cookieless surface that needs no credential to reach: a calendar client polls once per refresh interval (typically 15–60 minutes), so 20/minute is already generous for several devices behind one address. Widening it toward the `/api` budget would buy nothing for real clients.

Behind a trusted proxy (`TRUST_PROXY_ENABLED=true`), the per-IP key is the **rightmost untrusted `X-Forwarded-For` hop** relative to `TRUSTED_PROXIES` (`cmd/ovumcy/ratelimit.go` `rateLimitKeyGenerator`), not fiber's default leftmost `c.IP()`, so a client-spoofed XFF prefix cannot rotate the key and defeat the limit.

Plus per-account, identity-keyed budgets enforced by `AuthAttemptPolicy` (`internal/services/auth_attempt_policy.go`). Each budget admits and counts in one step: an attempt is reserved under both buckets before the password or code is compared, the reservation stays booked when the check fails, and a correct credential gives it back. The limit therefore bounds the checks that run, however many requests for one account arrive at once, for as long as the key's entry is tracked — the size cap that keeps the map bounded can evict an entry that is still short of its limit under a flood of more than 1024 distinct fresh keys in one scope (an entry at its limit is pinned). A storage or lookup error before a compare keeps its reservation, like a wrong credential: the budget fails closed. The one exception is the 2FA step claim failing after the code already matched, which gives the slot back, since the code was right and the fault tells a guesser nothing. A 2FA code that is not six digits is refused before the budget is consulted, since no compare happens for it:

- Recovery-code redemption (`POST /api/v1/password-resets`): 8 failures / 1 hour, tuned by the same `RATE_LIMIT_FORGOT_PASSWORD_MAX` / `RATE_LIMIT_FORGOT_PASSWORD_WINDOW` pair as that endpoint's per-IP row above, so the two budgets never drift apart. Wired as the `recovery` scope in `internal/services/password_reset_service.go`. A code that is merely malformed spends the budget exactly as a wrong-but-well-formed one does, so failing the format check early is not a free retry; only a submission with no email at all falls back to the client-keyed bucket alone, there being no identity to key on.
- Login attempts: 8 failures / 15 minutes, keyed on the plain login route (`POST /api/v1/sessions`). WEB-77 removed the only other route that used to check a submitted password against this same budget, the `/auth/oidc/link-confirm` handler (retained-but-unreachable since #701, deleted for good in WEB-77); see *Where a link is actually created* in [docs/security/oidc-and-sessions.md](oidc-and-sessions.md).
- Logout attempts: 20 per 15 minutes, keyed on the **owner** of the session being ended
  (`LogoutAttemptIdentity`). It deliberately does not name the session: `RevokeAuthSessions` bumps
  `AuthSessionVersion`, so the token is refused on the next request and no session reaches this
  route twice — a session-keyed budget would record one attempt per key, never trip, and leave the
  browser sign-out route (`POST /logout`, which the per-IP row above does not cover) with no
  account-side cap at all. Its client bucket is `(address, account)` like the re-authentication
  budget's, never the address by itself: that is the per-IP row's job, and a plain address bucket
  at this size ran a second, tighter per-address cap under it (a household behind one address, or a
  test run from one, was refused its 21st sign-out while each owner still had budget). Unlike the
  rows around it this one counts **every** logout,
  not only failures, so an owner's 21st sign-out inside the window is refused too. The
  check runs **after** `RevokeAuthSessions` and after the session cookies are cleared
  (`internal/api/handlers_auth_session_login.go`): a spent per-account budget never keeps a session alive on a
  device the owner is leaving; what the `429` withholds is the provider sign-out bridge and the
  success answer. A logout is an attempt against this budget only — it lives in its own limiter
  under its own scope and never adds a failure to, or resets, the login, recovery or TOTP budgets.
  Tuned by `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_ACCOUNT_MAX` / `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_ACCOUNT_WINDOW` — deliberately its
  own pair, not the `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_*` per-IP row above: the per-IP budget must stay wide enough
  for several owners behind one address, which is exactly why it cannot double as the account budget.
  That per-IP row is edge middleware and refuses before the handler, so it counts only answers
  below 400: an unauthenticated or token-less `DELETE` from a shared address is refused without
  spending it. It is counted while it is in flight, though, and a request the row answers `429`
  itself keeps its count, so concurrent refused requests can keep the row exhausted until the
  window ends.
- TOTP login challenge: 5 failures / 15 minutes.
- TOTP disable: 5 failures / 15 minutes, and not a budget of its own: the password check of
  `DELETE /api/v1/users/current/2fa` draws the settings re-authentication budget below, so a wrong
  password there and a wrong password on any settings action spend one per-account count. Once it
  is spent the endpoint answers `429` even for the correct password.
- TOTP enrollment code: 5 failures / 15 minutes, counting each wrong code submitted to
  `PUT /api/v1/users/current/2fa` (the TOTP-enrollment confirmation); that request's password
  draws the settings re-authentication budget below, which books only a wrong password. Once this
  budget is spent the endpoint answers `429` before the code is checked, even for the correct code,
  and only an enrollment that commits clears it. A missing or wrong-length code is refused without
  being counted. Keyed like the settings re-authentication budget, on `(client, account)` and on
  the account alone.
- Settings re-authentication: 5 failures / 15 minutes, one budget per account covering every password-gated settings action — `POST /api/v1/users/current/data-wipe/validate`, `POST …/data-wipe`, `DELETE /api/v1/users/current`, `PUT …/password`, `PUT …/2fa` (the TOTP-enrollment confirmation), `DELETE …/2fa` (the TOTP disable above), and `POST …/recovery-code` (recovery-code regeneration). A failure on any of them spends the same count, so a signed-in session gets no more password guesses in a window than the sign-in form allows, whichever endpoints it spreads them over; the login budget stays separate. Without it these would be faster password oracles than the login form (the `/api` catch-all allows 300 requests per minute against login's 8 per 15 minutes), and `/data-wipe/validate` changes no state, which makes it a pure oracle. Once the budget is spent the endpoints answer `429` even for the correct password. The budget is keyed on `(client, account)` and on the account alone, deliberately **not** on the client address by itself: several independent owners share one address on a household instance, and one owner mistyping must not lock out the others, while the account-wide bucket still caps an attacker rotating addresses.

Per-account budgets are keyed by `HMAC-SHA256(SECRET_KEY, "ovumcy.auth-attempt.identity.v1:" || identity)`, so the limiter never persists the raw identifier.

The login, recovery, TOTP and re-authentication budgets share one in-memory `AttemptLimiter`
(`internal/services/attempt_limiter.go`; the logout budget runs on a limiter of its own), whose
keys are partly attacker-chosen — the login form accepts any email — so it bounds its own memory:
a periodic sweep drops entries whose window has lapsed, and above 1024 live entries a scope is
trimmed back to that many, coldest first. Neither bound can lift a budget that is still live.
Every entry carries the scope, limit and window it was recorded under, so the sweep judges each
entry by its own window (a login failure's sweep does not erase a recovery entry forty minutes
early), the cap counts one scope at a time (a flood of login identities never reaches a TOTP or
recovery entry), and an entry at its limit — an active lockout — is pinned until it expires. What
bounds the pinned population is the attacker's own spend: each lockout costs `limit` refused
requests inside one window, which the per-IP rows above already meter.
