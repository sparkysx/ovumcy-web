// Webhook outbound delivery (issue #124, slice 3). This file owns the SINGLE
// egress point for owner-configured webhook reminders. It is security-critical:
// the URL it POSTs to is fully owner-controlled (self-hosted ntfy/Gotify/Apprise
// commonly live on the LAN), so the request envelope is hardened rather than the
// destination blocked.
//
// Envelope hardening (all mandatory, none configurable away):
//
//   - Hard total timeout via context.WithTimeout plus a matching client Timeout,
//     so a slow or hung endpoint cannot stall the notify pass; underneath it each
//     phase — dial, TLS handshake, response headers — carries its own smaller
//     budget so none can eat the whole of it.
//   - DisableKeepAlives: each delivery is a one-shot connection; we never pool to
//     an owner-controlled host.
//   - ZERO redirects: CheckRedirect always returns an error, so a 3xx response
//     cannot steer the request (or its body) to a second, unvalidated origin
//     after the scheme/host check passed (SSRF-via-redirect).
//   - Response body capped by io.LimitReader: we only need the status code, so we
//     read at most a few KB and discard the rest — a hostile endpoint cannot make
//     us buffer an unbounded body.
//   - Scheme allowlist http/https ONLY, re-checked here even though slice-1
//     save-time validation already enforced it (defence in depth: the decrypt
//     path or a direct DB edit could in principle yield another scheme).
//
// No-secret-in-transport/logs invariant: the webhook URL may embed an ntfy bearer
// token in its userinfo or query, so this file logs the HOSTNAME ONLY (never the
// full URL, path, query, or userinfo) and never logs the request/response body.
