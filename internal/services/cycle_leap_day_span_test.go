// The leap-day coverage in cycle_leap_day_test.go stops at PredictCycleWindow.
// These tests carry the same hand-counted calendar (February has 29 days in 2024,
// 28 in 2025 and 2100 — 2100 is divisible by 100 but not by 400) into the three
// places a cycle is measured: the cycle-length path, the calendar day difference
// every reader shares, and the BBT detection window. Every expected number is
// counted on the printed calendar, never derived from the implementation, and
// each case asserts both the span in calendar days and the cycle day it implies
// (one-based, so the day a cycle ends on is its length and the next start is
// length+1).
//
// The UTC rows hold the calendar and need no zone database. The rows in a
// non-UTC zone exist because a day difference taken as Sub(...).Hours()/24 is
// exact between two UTC midnights and wrong once an operand is a location
// midnight: a zone west of UTC against a UTC one (New York), two midnights of
// one zone across a DST jump (New York 2024-03-10, Berlin 2024-03-31), and a
// zone of +12h or more, where rounding instead of truncating also fails
// (Auckland, +13 in February and March 2024). A zone offset below 12h, such as
// Kolkata, is kept only as a control: it truncates to the right count.
