// beside one 300-day gap average 96, four of them average 82, while the median

// and leaves such a history exactly where it was: withheld from day 57, four
// days before its projected date. Suppression is the floor, so the gate may
// answer early and never late.
//
// It introduces no cutoff of its own. WHICH spans stop counting as a cycle, and
