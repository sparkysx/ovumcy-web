// Calendar (.ics) feed subscription — settings lifecycle handlers (slice 4).
//
// Three OwnerOnly + CSRF-protected endpoints let the owner manage the feed:
//   - POST   /api/v1/users/current/calendar-feed         → GenerateCalendarFeed
//   - POST   /api/v1/users/current/calendar-feed/rotate  → RotateCalendarFeed
//   - DELETE /api/v1/users/current/calendar-feed         → RevokeCalendarFeed
//
// All three are transport-only: CalendarFeedSettingsService owns token minting,
// persistence, and the status projection. Each is scoped strictly to the
// authenticated session's user id (currentUser), declares handler.OwnerOnly on
// its route, and is CSRF-protected by the global middleware (none is in the CSRF
// exemption list). None bumps auth_session_version — a per-surface feed
// capability is not an account credential; the recovery/compromise force-clear
// hooks live in the DB layer's atomic session-invalidation updates instead.
//
// SECRET HANDLING. The subscribe URL embeds the bearer token, so generate/rotate
// NEVER return it in the JSON/HTML body or a redirect query. Instead they seal
// the full URL into a one-time cookie (calendar_feed_reveal_cookie.go) and
// redirect to a dedicated reveal page that shows it exactly once, mirroring the
// recovery-code reveal. Revoke carries no secret. Nothing here logs the token.
//
// "Exactly once" is enforced by users.calendar_feed_revealed_at (migration 036),
// not by the cookie retraction: the mint NULLs the mark in the same write that
// persists the token, and the reveal page claims it with a compare-and-set. The
// cookie decides WHICH URL may be shown and the mark decides WHETHER it still
// may be, so a client that kept the sealed value gains nothing by presenting it
// again.
