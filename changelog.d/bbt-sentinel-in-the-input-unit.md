### Fixed

- **An impossible temperature is no longer saved as an empty one.** For an account tracking in
  Fahrenheit, any entry from just above 0 °F up to 32 °F was quietly filed as "not measured" —
  the day saved without a word, the reading gone — because the "no measurement" test ran on the
  converted Celsius value instead of on what was typed. It now runs in the account's own unit: 0
  or less still means "not measured", and anything above it is judged against the physiological
  range and refused if it falls outside. The day form rejects such a value in the browser, so it
  was reachable through the JSON API, or from the form with scripts off. An infinity typed into
  the form is refused the same way, where a negative one used to be filed as "not measured" too.
- **A hidden field can no longer refuse the day it is not part of.** A form save from an account
  that hides temperature or cycle factors no longer loses the whole entry to a value in the hidden
  field: the form's hidden fields are not read at all — on an existing day the stored reading is
  kept, on a new day the field starts empty. JSON bodies carry every field they send.
