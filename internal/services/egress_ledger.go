// The egress ledger: one owner-scoped account of every path by which anything
// about an owner can leave this instance, and of what each path can PROVE.
//
// The organizing rule is that a rendered state is a proposition whose falsifier
// the code can detect. "Active" is not such a proposition for a calendar feed:
// the verifier plaintext is never stored and its MAC cannot be recomputed, so a
// selector proves a row exists and nothing else — after a SECRET_KEY rotation
// the row still has a selector and the issued link no longer resolves. Nor is a
// claim watermark a delivery time: it is a cycle anchor written BEFORE the POST
// and restored when the POST fails. Every field below is chosen so that the
// sentence it drives can be shown wrong by something the instance observes.
//
// What is deliberately absent is as load-bearing as what is here. There is no
// count, no "in use" and no rotation history for the .ics feed: polls are
// unaudited on purpose, and adding a field here beyond the one exception below
// is how that decision would be reversed by accident. The one exception is
// LastPolledOn (migration 040, WEB-46): the owner's calendar day of the most
// recent successful, token-verified poll, coarsened to day granularity with no
// IP, no user agent and no per-request row — an owner-facing signal, not a
// per-request log. There is no "revoked" either — revoke,
// the restore fence, the rotation sentinel and a recovery-code regeneration all
// clear the same three columns, so "revoked" is indistinguishable from "never
// created" and would be a sentence with no falsifier.
