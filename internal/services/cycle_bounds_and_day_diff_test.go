// TestCycleLengthsCountsCalendarDaysAcrossADSTTransition pins the arithmetic at
// cycleLengths, the one day-difference site of the three in cycles.go whose
// operands do NOT pass through dateOnly inside the function: `starts` arrives as
// a parameter, so the anchor is the caller's business.
//
// Europe/Berlin springs forward on 2026-03-29, so local midnight on 2026-03-28
// and local midnight on 2026-03-30 are 47 hours apart, not 48. Measured in
// hours, `int(47/24)` reports a 1-day cycle; measured in calendar days it is 2.
// The same shortfall shows up with no transition involved whenever one operand
// is a location midnight and the other a UTC one.
//
// A missing zone database SKIPS this test on a developer machine — the same
// answer the other tz-dependent tests in this package give, all routed
// through testenv.RequireTimeZone — and FAILS it on a lane that set
// OVUMCY_REQUIRE_TZDATA. The module imports time/tzdata nowhere, so zones come
// from the host. What never goes quiet, on any machine, is
// TestCalendarDayDiffBarrier, which reads the source rather than the clock
// and refuses the shape with no zone database at all — so the class stays
// barred even where this proof of it cannot run.
