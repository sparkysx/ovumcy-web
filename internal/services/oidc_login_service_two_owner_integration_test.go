// test seeds a single identity, so nothing in the tree sees that today. Here
// each owner has an identity under a different issuer with the SAME subject,
// and owner A is created first — so it holds id 1 and its identity sorts first,
// which is what a lookup degraded to subject-only would return.

// The IdP itself stays a double: only the code exchange is replaced, and the
// property under test is which stored identity the claims resolve to, not how
// the claims were obtained.
