# Logging Policy

_Part of the [Ovumcy security policy](../../SECURITY.md)._

## Logging Policy

Ovumcy does **not** emit per-action audit logs by default. The `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` environment variable controls the audit-event stream:

- `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=false` (default) — the runtime emits no `security event:` lines. Everything else keeps writing: Go panics, startup configuration errors and warnings, the Fiber request log, and a small set of operational diagnostics described below.
- `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true` — the runtime emits per-action security-event lines to stderr via the Go standard `log` package. Each line includes the action name, outcome, request method, **sanitized** request path (concrete date parameters are replaced with `:date` and other identifiers are similarly masked), response format, and — for authenticated requests — `user_id` and role. Example:

  ```
  security event: action="health.day_upsert" outcome="success" method="PUT"
                  path="/api/v1/days/:date" format="json" user_id="42"
                  role="owner" domain="health_data" target="day_entry"
  ```

  An action that changes health data carries the two further fields shown above: `domain="health_data"`, and a `target` naming the scope it touched (`day_entry`, `symptom`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_settings`, `tracking_settings`, `reminder_settings`, `webhook_settings`, `calendar_feed`, `timezone`, and — for the two actions that erase everything — `account_data` for a full data wipe, `account` for an account deletion; the eleven values are the distinct targets of the `healthMutationKind` declarations in `internal/api`). The target is a fixed designator chosen per action, never an identifier, an email, or submitted text, so an incident review can filter on `domain="health_data"` to select the data-changing actions, erasures included.

  One action carries a third field. `health.cycle_start_mark` adds `cycle_start_policy="unresolved"` when the implantation-caution policy could not be resolved for that mark. The request still succeeds and still answers `204`; the caution is suppressed, which is the safe direction for a prediction claim, but a suppressed caution and a caution that was never warranted are indistinguishable from outside. The field is the only signal that the check did not run. It is absent on every mark where the policy resolved, so its presence — not its value — is what an alert matches on.

  The filter is a statement about the **effect** of an action, not about the sensitivity of the value submitted. Two settings therefore carry it although neither value is itself an observation: the reminder lead window (`settings.reminders_update`) decides when a cycle prediction is announced, including off-host through the webhook, and the stored timezone (`settings.timezone_update`) is the zone the request-free passes resolve "today" in, so changing it re-dates which calendar day a predicted period falls on without a single day record changing. For the same reason the filter selects onboarding: `onboarding.cycle_start_update` and `onboarding.cycle_update` write the same `users` columns the settings cycle form writes, and `onboarding.complete` seeds the first period's day records, so "were the cycle settings changed?" is answerable whichever surface the owner used.

  A mutation that changes the account record without touching the cycle record is audited under `domain="account"` instead — today that is `settings.profile_update` (`target="profile"`), the display name. It is deliberately outside `domain="health_data"`: nothing in the cycle math reads a display name, and a filter that selected it would stop meaning what it says. One account column is deliberately excluded from the stream rather than audited: `PATCH /api/v1/users/current/interface` and `POST /lang` emit no mutation event, although for a signed-in owner both persist `users.interface_language` (migration 034) — the column a fresh device is served on its next sign-in. The value is a presentation preference that neither the cycle math nor the security posture reads, so its writes are a declared exclusion, not an oversight; the theme, submitted with the same form, has no account-side half — it stays in client-side storage.

  An action that carries health data **out** of the instance is tagged the same way but under a **separate** domain, `domain="health_egress"`:

  ```
  security event: action="data.export" outcome="success" method="GET"
                  path="/api/v1/exports/csv" format="html" user_id="42"
                  role="owner" domain="health_egress" export_format="csv"
                  target="account_data"
  ```

  This is a third distinct value rather than a modifier on `health_data`, for the same reason `account` is one: each domain answers a different question, and a domain that answers two answers neither precisely. `domain="health_data"` answers *was tracked data changed or destroyed?* and keeps selecting exactly the actions it selected before this split — an erasure review must not start collecting every routine CSV download. `domain="health_egress"` answers *did any tracked data leave, from which account, and in what form?*. A review that wants both health classes at once matches the shared prefix in one clause (`domain="health_`).

  Three actions are tagged as egress today:

  | Action | `target` | Emitted when |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `data.export` | `account_data` | A CSV, JSON or summary export is served, refused, or fails. `export_format` (`csv` / `json` / `summary`) is on **every** outcome, including a request refused before any data is read, so a rejected download is still attributable to the format that was asked for. |
  | `settings.calendar_feed_reveal` | `calendar_feed` | The one-time page shows the `.ics` subscribe URL. |
  | `auth.recovery_code_reveal` | `recovery_code` | A recovery code is displayed — on the dedicated page or in the register page's inline block; the sanitized `path` distinguishes the two. |

  Two properties hold for every egress line. The event records the **fact** of the disclosure, never the value: no subscribe URL, no feed token, and no recovery code ever reaches a log line. And the audited moment is the one where the data or the secret reaches a person — which is why the subscribe URL is audited when it is revealed and **not** on each later poll of `GET /calendar/feed/:token.ics`; the reasoning for that boundary is recorded under *Calendar-feed polling is not audited* in [Known Information Disclosure](known-disclosures.md).

When enabled, these lines are visible to the operator through their container runtime (`docker compose logs`, journald, etc.) and never leave the host. They are intended for ad-hoc incident investigation — for example, to confirm whether a suspected compromise produced state-changing requests, and from which `user_id`. The audit stream is not designed as a compliance audit trail; nothing in Ovumcy itself ships, archives, or rotates these lines.

If you enable `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=true`, plan retention and access control around the persistent-identifier content (`user_id`, role). Treat the resulting log stream as the same sensitivity class as the database itself.

The Fiber request log (`time | status | latency | method | path | error`) is independent of `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` and remains enabled in all configurations. It does not include `user_id` or authenticated-session metadata. Both of its potentially sensitive columns are sanitized before they are written: the path through `SafeRequestLogPath` (route template, opaque tokens masked) and the trailing error through `SafeLogError`, which masks emails, opaque tokens, recovery codes and submitted one-time codes so a handler error string cannot carry an account identifier or a credential into the log. Short secrets are matched by shape rather than by length — a recovery code and a six-digit code are both too short for the opaque-token rule — so that dates, status codes, route templates and ordinary identifiers stay readable for diagnosis.

The startup banner reflects the current setting (`audit_log=true|false`) so operators can confirm the effective configuration on each boot.

## Operational diagnostics (always on)

A handful of lines outside both streams above report that an internal operation could not complete. They are always enabled, and **six of them name an owner by `user_id`**, so `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED=false` does not mean "no account identifier ever reaches the log":

- the derived-cycle refresh that follows a day write, when it cannot load that owner's logs or store the recomputed luteal phase (`refreshDerivedCycleSettings: … for user N failed: …`) — the only two lines here that also carry the raw driver error, which does not pass through `SafeLogError`;
- the webhook reminder pass, when an owner's stored endpoint cannot be decrypted, their logs cannot be loaded, the pre-send watermark claim fails, or the watermark release fails after a failed delivery (`webhook notify: … owner id=N`) — the watermark is claimed *before* the send, so there is no post-success write left to fail;
- the flash cookie, when the message that explains an error cannot be encoded or sealed (`flash cookie: encode failed: …`, `flash cookie: sealed write failed: …`) — the request still redirects, so without it an operator sees only unexplained redirects. It names no account: the reason only, through `SafeLogError`, never the payload.

One further always-on group names no `user_id` but does expose the destination **hostname** of an owner's configured webhook: the delivery skip/failure lines (`webhook delivery skipped: reason=… host=…`, `webhook delivery failed: reason=… host=…`; the unparseable-URL skip carries no `host=` — there is nothing parsed to name). The host is a fragment of the otherwise-encrypted `webhook_url`, and every line takes it from the same `parsed.Hostname()` — never the path, query or userinfo; the failure line's host-only shape is test-pinned (`TestWebhookDeliveryLogsHostOnly`).

None of them carries health data, an email, a full URL, or a token — the identifier (or the destination host) and the reason only. The first pair is a symptom of write contention (see *Concurrency on the SQLite baseline* in [docs/self-hosted.md](../self-hosted.md#concurrency-on-the-sqlite-baseline)); the second is how a `SECRET_KEY` rotation surfaces for webhook owners, and is the signal the reminder pass's own summary does not carry.

If your deployment treats any `user_id` in a log — or the webhook destination hostname the delivery lines carry — as sensitive, plan retention and access control for the default stream too, not only for the audit stream.
