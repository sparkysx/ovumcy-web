// PublishedStats returns the CycleStats a surface may PUBLISH — the computed
// stats with every forward-looking value the display policy refuses cleared, so
// the data cannot outlive the decision — together with the verdict that cleared
// it.
//
// Suppression on these surfaces used to be a template obligation — one boolean
// beside the full CycleStats it was supposed to hide — and a template that
// forgets the boolean, a new partial, a JSON view or a debug dump of the struct
// then publishes a claim the product has decided it must not make. Cleared here,
// the same forgetful surface renders nothing instead of a suppressed estimate.
// That failure was not hypothetical: GET /api/v1/stats/overview serialized the
// domain struct whole, so every date /stats withheld left the instance as JSON.
//
// It serves EVERY surface that publishes a projection — /stats, the dashboard,
// the JSON API, the webhook reminder pass and the .ics feed — and stays one
// function rather than one per surface: a second implementation of the clearing
// rule is precisely how /stats and the dashboard came to disagree in the first
// place. The two egress passes recompute their dates from the anchors this
// function does not touch (LastPeriodStart, LutealPhase) and withhold on the
// verdict, so there the clearing is a floor under a later edit rather than a
// change of what they send today.
//
// The verdict is returned rather than re-resolved by the caller: a surface that
// asks the predicates a second time can be holding cleared stats by then, and
// FertilityProjectionSuppressed reads fields this function empties.
//
// CurrentPhase is RECOMPUTED from the cleared fields below, not left standing
// on the pre-clearing geometry it was originally derived from. Phase and
// fertility are orthogonal axes here (#416): the taxonomy is
// menstrual/follicular/ovulation/luteal/unknown and "fertile" is a status,
// never a phase — but resolveCyclePhase itself reads OvulationDate to decide
// between them, so a phase computed before this function clears that date
// names the day suppression withholds ("ovulation" today, "follicular" or
// "luteal" any other day of the cycle). Leaving it standing let a suppressed
// account read the ovulation day straight off the phase label on the
// dashboard, /stats and the JSON API, even with OvulationDate itself blank.
// The fix is not to empty the copy either — the dashboard hero rebuilds its
// own phase from the cycle geometry (dashboardCycleHeroCurrentPhase) and the
// header prefers the hero's, so emptying the published copy would split one
// page across two answers — but to recompute it from the SAME fields this
// function just cleared: both sides then read the same geometry, and a
// suppressed account's phase can still say "menstrual" during a logged or
// projected period, or "unknown" the rest of the cycle, without ever pointing
// at the withheld day.
//
// RECORDED history — observed cycle lengths, the last period start, the current
// cycle day — is never touched: it is fact, not projection, and the "facts only"
// tier exists precisely to keep showing it. Only the PUBLISHED copy is cleared;
// every builder behind a page reads the full stats, because the ribbon, the
// factor context and the cycle context each apply their own suppression rule to
// it.
//
// OUT-OF-DATE DATA withholds the phase and the fertility status, and nothing
// else. Once the running cycle has passed the account's reference length
// (DashboardCycleDataLooksStale) both owner pages answer "unknown" for the
// phase and the status wherever they show a phase at all — dashboard.html tests
// CycleDataStale first, stats.html first inside its predictions-enabled branch —
// while the projected dates stay published beside the out-of-date banner. A
// status read against a window the cycle has already outrun is a projection
// past its own reference range, which the medical-safety floor refuses;
// publishing it on the JSON API alone is the divergence this function exists to
// close. The verdict is the pages' own — dashboardCycleDataStale, the one helper
// the dashboard context and the stats page flags also call — and it is NOT a
// suppression signal: the two suppression bits also decide what the webhook
// pass and the .ics feed send, and staleness withholds no date. CycleDataStale
// carries the verdict on the published copy.

// PublishedOverviewStats is PublishedStats plus the confirmed-ovulation
// substitution the on-screen surfaces already apply: the calendar's solid
// marker (calendar_days.go), the dashboard's ovulation line
// (dashboard_cycle.go) and the stats chart marker all resolve the CURRENT
// cycle's ovulation day through ConfirmedCurrentCycleOvulation, so a shift
// the owner's own temperatures already confirm outranks the model's
// projection everywhere an owner reads it.
//
// The substitution is ResolveConfirmedCycleStats and covers the whole triple —
// day, window, fertility status — rather than the date alone: this function
// used to move the date and leave the window and CurrentFertility on the
// projection, which published a confirmed day beside a window that disagreed
// with it.
//
// The JSON API was the one surface that skipped this: it read stats.
// OvulationDate straight off the model and published it even after a BBT
// shift had superseded it, while the grid, the dashboard and the chart had
// already moved on to the confirmed day. The substitution runs on the RAW
// stats, ahead of PublishedStats' own clearing, for the same reason the
// dashboard's runs ahead of its suppression branches: ConfirmedCurrentCycleOvulation
// already reads its own gate (ConfirmedOvulationWithheld), so a confirmed day
// never outlives a tier that withholds it, and running it first means PublishedStats sees the same OvulationDate every
// other surface renders.
//
// The returned bool is the SAME "confirmed" bit the dashboard carries beside
// its own OvulationExact (dashboard_cycle.go's DisplayOvulationConfirmed) —
// deliberately a second signal, not a rewrite of the first. OvulationExact
// keeps its own meaning (an exact luteal-phase fit vs a clamped estimate,
// CalcOvulationDay); a BBT-confirmed day on a fallback-luteal account is
// "confirmed" and still arithmetically "not exact" until it feeds back into
// InferUserLutealPhase on a LATER cycle, and collapsing the two into one
// boolean would make the JSON view unable to say which is true — exactly the
// class of divergence PublishedStats itself exists to prevent, just one field
// over.
//
// The bool is READ BACK off `published.OvulationDate` after PublishedStats has
// run, rather than kept from the ConfirmedCurrentCycleOvulation call above:
// today the two agree by construction (the day is put back below exactly when
// the confirmation passed its own gate, ConfirmedOvulationWithheld), but a bool decided before the clearing and never
// revisited would depend on that agreement holding forever across two files. A
// suppressed projection reporting a confirmed day is exactly the medical-safety
// floor this adapter exists to hold, so the field is derived from the
// CLEARED stats it is published beside: it cannot outlive the date it
// describes even if a future suppression signal reaches one predicate and not
// the other. The read-back compares the DAY, not the presence of a date: a tier
// that one day SUBSTITUTES another date instead of clearing the field must not
// be able to report "confirmed" about a day the shift never named. Today
// PublishedStats only zeroes OvulationDate, so day equality and a presence check
// coincide by construction — which is why the stricter one is written here.

	// outrun the length its projection was rolled from and the day the owner's
	// temperatures named is not such a projection. It used to come back only
	// under the fertility gate, a second condition that agreed with that owner
	// only while every signal withholding the day was also a fertility signal.
	// The clearing above keeps the window, the fertility status, its basis and
	// the phase it withheld; only the day comes back, so the JSON API names what
