// TestMR3Cycles_PotentialImplantationRefusesTheDefaultCycleLength pins the
// first-cycle floor at the end of the policy, on the one history that reaches
// the hint with nothing recorded behind it: the anchor comes from the settings
// LastPeriodStart, not from a log, so there are no observed cycle lengths and
// predictedCycleLength would answer with models.DefaultCycleLength. The hint
// counted from that default is an inference presented as a measurement, so it
// is withheld — the FertilityProjectionSuppressed -> PredictionsSuppressed
// mutant reddens here.
//
// It does NOT cover the cycleLength <= 0 fallback further down — nothing this
// caller can build reaches it (the reason is recorded there), which is why the
// `<= 0` -> `< 0` mutant on those two lines is equivalent and why the name
// never advertised a zero-cycle-length fallback.
