// outbound_confirmed_ovulation_test.go — the two surfaces that leave the
// instance stop announcing an ovulation the temperatures have already answered.
//
// The on-screen surfaces replace the projected day with the confirmed one, and
// the .ics feed now does too, as an event of its own. The webhook reminder
// cannot: it exists to announce a day still ahead. Left alone both egress
// surfaces kept publishing the projection, so on the projected day
// itself the owner read the confirmed day on the dashboard and the grid and the
// projected day in a subscribed calendar and in a payload leaving the instance —
// two dates for one shift, at the moment the gap between them is largest.

// 2026-03-11, while the model projects cycle day 14: 2026-03-14, which is also
// "today". withShift=false returns the same cycles with no temperatures at all,
