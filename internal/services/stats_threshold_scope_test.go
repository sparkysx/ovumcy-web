// The stats page carries three sample-size thresholds that are all 3 or 2
// today, and reading them as one number is the mistake this test exists to
// stop:
//
//   - statsMinimumInsightsCycles (2) — the basic-insights tier, counted in
//     completed cycles;
//   - minimumPhaseInsightCycles (3) — the pattern minimum, counted in completed
//     cycles, gating every surface that claims a pattern rather than a single
//     observation, the cycle-length trend sentence included;
//   - statsReliableTrendCycles (3) — counted in trend POINTS, gating the
//     chart's reliability flag alone.
//
// The two 3s answer different questions about different quantities, so they are
// kept as two names rather than collapsed into one. That is only safe while a
// change to either is visible: each surface below is driven at its own boundary
// through its own entry point, never by reading a constant back, so moving one
// threshold reddens exactly the surfaces it governs and names them.
