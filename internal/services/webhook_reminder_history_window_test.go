// history. The cycle lengths, the completed-cycle count and the overdue verdict
// all read what they are given, so an owner whose old cycles outlive the window
// was paused in the app while a reminder built from a different set of cycles
// left the instance for a third-party endpoint — or the reverse, a reminder
// withheld that the dashboard still showed.
//
// The histories below are the ones that expose it. Only the last
// cyclePredictionWindow cycle lengths feed the statistics, so old cycles reach
// them only when fewer recent lengths exist to fill it, and the span between the
// last old start and the first recent one is itself counted as a cycle length.

// today. The starts are what CycleBoundaries reads, so the spans between them
