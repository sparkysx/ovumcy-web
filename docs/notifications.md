# Reminders & Notifications

Ovumcy can remind an owner about an upcoming period or ovulation through three
independent, self-hosted channels: an in-app dashboard banner, an outbound
webhook (for example a self-hosted [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) or
[Gotify](https://gotify.net/) instance), and a private, read-only calendar
(`.ics`) subscription. All three read the same underlying prediction and the
same per-owner lead-time setting; the calendar feed also carries the current
cycle's ovulation day once the owner's temperature readings confirm it. No third-party notification service is
required or built in: this is a zero-cost, self-hosted notification model,
consistent with Ovumcy's single-tenant, operator-controlled design. The endpoints and calendar clients an
owner chooses may themselves be third-party services — a hosted webhook target,
or a calendar account at Google or Apple subscribed to the feed — and those then
receive the reminder data. Which third party, if any, sees it is the owner's
choice, not something Ovumcy arranges.

> Webhook reminders only ever announce a day that is still ahead.

This document covers all three channels: what each one is, how an owner
enables it, and — for the webhook channel, which needs a scheduled delivery
pass — how an operator wires that up.

## 1. In-app dashboard banner

When a period or ovulation is predicted soon, the dashboard shows a small
reminder banner ("Period likely today", "…likely tomorrow", or "…likely in
~N days"). This needs no setup beyond normal cycle tracking — it is on by
default for any owner with enough logged data to produce a single-date
estimate.

**How to configure it:** on the Settings page, under **Reminders**, the
**Reminder lead time (days)** field controls how many days ahead of the
estimated date the banner starts showing.

- Range: **0–14** days. A value outside that range is clamped, not rejected.
- Default: **3** days.
- 0 means "only show it on the day itself."
- This setting is **shared** with the webhook channel below — one lead-time
  value drives both the dashboard banner and the webhook "notify before"
  timing. There is no separate lead time for webhooks.

The banner never shows a prediction that is itself suppressed or uncertain —
for example while cycle length is still unpredictable, or when the dashboard
is already displaying a date range instead of an exact date — so it never
contradicts the main prediction surface.

## 2. Webhook notifications

Ovumcy can POST a small JSON message to a webhook URL the owner controls when
a period or ovulation reminder becomes due — the same prediction and the same
lead-time setting the dashboard banner uses.

### How to enable it

On the Settings page, under **Webhook reminders**:

1. Enter your webhook URL (for example a self-hosted ntfy topic URL or a
   Gotify endpoint) in the **Webhook URL** field. This field is **write-only**:
   once saved, it always renders blank — the stored value is never redisplayed
   in the browser, even to the owner who set it. Leave it blank on a later save
   to keep the current endpoint unchanged; use the dedicated **Remove saved
   URL** checkbox to clear it.
2. Turn on **Enable webhook reminders**. A URL must already be configured (or
   supplied in the same save) to enable delivery.
3. Choose **Notify before period** and/or **Notify before ovulation**
   independently — each is its own on/off switch.
4. Save. The URL is validated as an absolute `http`/`https` address and is
   stored **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM, bound to your account) — a
   ntfy/Gotify access token embedded in the URL is protected the same way.

The same settings can also be read and changed from the local operator CLI
(`ovumcy webhook show|set <email> ...`) — see
[Configuring webhook settings from the CLI](#configuring-webhook-settings-from-the-cli)
below. That path is for an operator managing an account from the server shell,
not a replacement for the Settings-page form.

### How delivery works

Delivery is a **request-free batch pass**: at pass time, Ovumcy looks at every
owner, decides whose reminders are due, and POSTs each due reminder to that
owner's configured webhook. It is **not** a request-triggered notification —
nothing fires from a page load. Two independent ways to run that pass:

- **`ovumcy notify`** — a CLI subcommand an operator schedules externally
  (cron, systemd timer, a Docker one-shot, or Windows Task Scheduler). Off by
  default in the sense that nothing runs until you schedule it.
- **The built-in daily scheduler** (optional, off by default) — an in-process
  goroutine that runs the identical batch pass automatically once a day, with
  no external scheduler required. See
  [The built-in daily scheduler](#the-built-in-daily-scheduler) below.

Use whichever fits your deployment: the CLI pass if you already manage cron/
systemd/Task Scheduler for this host, or the built-in scheduler if you would
rather not maintain an external schedule at all. Running both is unnecessary
but harmless (delivery is idempotent — see
[Idempotency and safety](#idempotency-and-safety)).

#### The `ovumcy notify` CLI

```
usage: ovumcy notify [--dry-run] [--show-health-details] [--fail-on-delivery-error]
```

- `--dry-run` computes what **would** be sent — owners scanned, reminders due,
  and a preview line per owner endpoint (owner id, how many reminders are
  pending, destination **host only**) — but makes no outbound HTTP request and
  writes no watermark. Use it to verify a schedule or a fresh deployment before
  it starts actually delivering. The preview deliberately leaves out each
  reminder's type and estimated date; see `--show-health-details` below.
- `--show-health-details` adds the per-reminder specifics back to the
  `--dry-run` preview: one line per reminder with its type (`period-soon` /
  `ovulation-soon`) and estimated date. **That output is health data about an
  identified owner** — a predicted period or ovulation date — so it is off by
  default and must be treated like the database itself: read it on the terminal,
  do not redirect it into a shared log, a cron mailer, or an install-script
  transcript. The flag has no effect without `--dry-run` (a delivery pass
  produces no preview at all).
- `--fail-on-delivery-error` makes the process exit non-zero if **any**
  individual delivery failed during the pass. Without it (the default), a
  single unreachable owner endpoint is treated as an expected transient — the
  pass still exits 0 as long as it completed, so a monitoring system watching
  the process exit code will not page on one owner's Gotify instance being
  briefly offline. The failed delivery is retried automatically on the next
  scheduled pass (see [Idempotency](#idempotency-and-safety)). Turn the flag on
  if you specifically want your scheduler (cron mailer, systemd
  `OnFailure=`, etc.) to surface delivery failures.
- A pass-level failure (cannot open the database, invalid `SECRET_KEY`, bad
  arguments) always exits non-zero, regardless of the flag.
- By default the command prints only aggregate counts, owner ids, and
  destination hosts to stdout — never a URL, token, reminder type, or estimated
  date — so its output is safe to capture in an operator log or cron mailer.
  `--show-health-details` is the single exception, and it is opt-in for exactly
  that reason.

Run it once daily at a fixed local hour that suits your household — for
example, mid-morning, so a period-due reminder for today already reflects
"today" in the owner's own timezone rather than the previous day rolling over
mid-cycle-check. See [Timezone behavior](#timezone-behavior) below for exactly
which zone "today" is evaluated in.

##### Scheduling it

Wire `ovumcy notify` up to whatever scheduler your host already uses — cron,
a systemd service+timer pair, a one-off `docker compose run --rm ovumcy /app/ovumcy notify`
against the bundled compose service, or Windows Task Scheduler all work
equally well, since the command itself is just a single CLI invocation. For
example, with cron:

```cron
# Run the Ovumcy webhook notify pass daily at 09:00 in the server's local time.
0 9 * * * SECRET_KEY_FILE=/etc/ovumcy/secret_key DB_DRIVER=sqlite DB_PATH=/var/lib/ovumcy/ovumcy.db /usr/local/bin/ovumcy notify >> /var/log/ovumcy-notify.log 2>&1
```

Adjust `DB_DRIVER`/`DB_PATH` (or `DATABASE_URL` for Postgres) and the secret
source to match your deployment's actual environment; the same environment
variables apply regardless of which scheduler invokes the command.

Redirecting the output into a log file, as above, is safe for the scheduled
pass and for a plain `--dry-run`: neither prints a reminder type or an
estimated date. Do **not** add `--show-health-details` to a scheduled or
redirected invocation — that flag exists to put predictions on an operator's
terminal on request, not into a log file that is likely to be world-readable,
shipped to a log collector, or swept into a backup with weaker protection than
the database.

##### Recommended cadence

Once daily, at a fixed local hour, across all of the above. There is no
supported sub-daily interval requirement — the shared reminder lead-time
setting already gives several days of lead time, so a once-a-day pass is
sufficient to catch every due reminder before the event. Running it more than
once a day is harmless (idempotent — see below) but unnecessary.

#### The built-in daily scheduler

Instead of (or in addition to) scheduling `ovumcy notify` externally, the
server binary can run the identical batch pass itself, once a day, with no
cron/systemd/Task Scheduler needed. It is **opt-in and off by default** — a
brand-new deployment makes no outbound webhook calls until you turn it on.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `false` | Turns the built-in scheduler on. When `false` (the default), no scheduler goroutine, timer, or outbound component exists in the running process at all. |
| `REMINDER_SCHEDULER_HOUR` | `9` | The **local hour of day** (0–23) the daily pass runs at, in the server's configured timezone (`TZ`; see [Timezone behavior](#timezone-behavior)). There is no separate scheduler timezone. |

Set both as regular environment variables (`.env` for Docker, or your
process/unit environment for a direct binary):

```env
REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true
REMINDER_SCHEDULER_HOUR=9
```

Notes:

- This is an **always-on** component once enabled: it makes outbound webhook
  calls from the running server process every day at the configured hour, for
  as long as the process runs — there is no separate "pause" toggle short of
  setting `REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` and restarting. Startup logs a
  clear one-line note whenever it is on, naming the hour and timezone.
- Delivery still requires each owner to have their own webhook configured and
  enabled in Settings — turning the scheduler on does not itself send
  anything to an owner who hasn't set up a webhook.
- If the process was down when the scheduled hour passed, it catches up with
  **at most one pass for the current day** on the next start — it never
  backfills multiple missed days.
- If a pass fails before it can send anything (the database was unreachable, so
  the list of owners could not be read), the day is **not** counted as done: the
  pass is retried a few minutes later, up to three attempts, and only then does
  the scheduler give up until the next day's hour. A restart in between still
  catches the day up, and the idempotency watermark below means a retry never
  re-sends a reminder an earlier attempt already delivered.
- On graceful shutdown (`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`), the server waits briefly for an
  in-flight pass to finish before closing the database.
- It reuses the exact same delivery path, idempotency watermark, and security
  hardening as the `ovumcy notify` CLI (below) — running both is unnecessary
  but not harmful.

#### Configuring webhook settings from the CLI

An operator with local shell access to the instance can also inspect or set an
owner's webhook configuration directly, without going through the browser:

```
usage: ovumcy webhook <show|set> <email> [--enabled=<bool>] [--notify-period=<bool>] [--notify-ovulation=<bool>] [--reminder-lead-days=<0-14>] [--url-stdin] [--clear-url] [--dry-run]
```

- `ovumcy webhook show <email>` prints the owner's current settings: whether
  delivery is enabled, the endpoint **host only** (never the full URL or any
  embedded token), and the notify-period/notify-ovulation toggles.
- `ovumcy webhook set <email> --enabled=true --notify-period=true --url-stdin`
  configures settings. Boolean flags take an explicit `=true`/`=false` value so
  an unspecified flag leaves that setting untouched.
- The webhook URL is a **secret** (it can embed an ntfy/Gotify access token)
  and is deliberately **never accepted as a command-line argument** — argv
  leaks into shell history and process listings on a shared host. Supply it
  instead via the `OVUMCY_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable for the single
  invocation, or interactively with `--url-stdin` (a no-echo terminal prompt,
  or the first line of piped stdin). It is never echoed back.
- Those two sources are **mutually exclusive**: supplying both is refused with
  an error naming each of them, and nothing is written. A left-over export — an
  operator profile, an earlier invocation, a compose `env_file` inherited by
  `docker compose run` — would otherwise silently outrank the URL you just
  piped in and arm that owner's reminders at the wrong endpoint. Unset the
  variable, or drop the flag. (`--clear-url` is unaffected: it removes any
  stored endpoint, so it cannot arm the wrong one, and it still works with the
  variable exported.)
- `--clear-url` removes any stored endpoint; `--dry-run` validates and prints
  the result without writing anything.

This CLI path and the Settings-page form write to the exact same columns —
either is fine for a self-hosted single-owner setup, and the CLI is
particularly useful for scripted provisioning (for example, setting a default
webhook as part of an install script that also runs `ovumcy users create`).

### Idempotency and safety

- Each reminder kind (period, ovulation) has its own **watermark**, storing
  the cycle-start anchor date the reminder was last successfully sent for.
- The watermark is **claimed before the request goes out** and given back when
  the request fails, so a failed delivery (timeout, non-2xx, refused redirect,
  connection error) leaves the watermark exactly where the pass found it. The
  claim is what makes two passes running *at the same time* safe as well: it is
  taken by a conditional write that only one of them can win, so the pass that
  loses it skips the reminder instead of sending a second copy.
- Consequence: re-running the pass is always safe.
  - A reminder already delivered this cycle is not sent again.
  - A reminder whose delivery *returned* an error is retried automatically on
    the next pass, with no separate retry mechanism to configure — the schedule
    itself **is** the retry loop.
  - The one exception: because the claim is taken before the request, a pass that
    is **killed outright** between the two — the host reboots, the container is
    evicted or OOM-killed, an interactive `ovumcy notify` is interrupted — leaves
    the reminder marked as handled although nothing was delivered, and that
    cycle's reminder is then skipped for good. The trade is deliberate: a
    reminder is a convenience, a duplicate reminder about health data sent to an
    endpoint is not, so the pass prefers to miss one rather than send it twice.
    If a reminder you expected never arrived and the logs show the pass dying
    mid-run, that is this case; the next cycle is unaffected.
- This means you can run the pass (or the built-in scheduler) on an ordinary
  daily schedule and never worry about double-notifying an owner because a
  previous run overlapped, was re-triggered, or ran twice due to a scheduler
  misconfiguration.
- **Turning the webhook off takes effect immediately — including while a pass is
  already running.** A pass reads every owner's settings once, at the start, and
  sends each reminder some time later, so a change you make in between has to
  reach it. Disabling delivery, replacing the endpoint, removing it, changing the
  reminder lead time, and clearing all your data each mark the settings the
  running pass is holding as superseded, and the claim it takes just before every
  request is refused once that has happened. A pass still working through the
  owner list therefore cannot deliver to an endpoint you have just removed.
  - The one thing this cannot do is recall a request that has already left. If
    the pass had already sent the POST at the moment you changed the setting,
    that one request completes — nothing can unsend it. Every request after it is
    refused. If the destination matters for a secret you are rotating, treat the
    old endpoint as having possibly received one final reminder.
  - Saving the **webhook** settings counts as a change even when you edited
    nothing, so a save landing while the pass runs costs you that pass's
    remaining reminders; they arrive on the next run. (The lead-time form is
    different: it skips the write when what you submit matches the value the page
    was rendered with, so re-submitting it unchanged normally costs nothing.) The
    exception is a lead time of **0 days**, where a reminder is due on one
    calendar day only — no later run still covers it, so that cycle's reminder is
    skipped rather than delayed. On a zero-day lead time, change settings at an
    hour the pass is not running.
- A pass never fails all owners because of one bad owner: a decrypt failure, a
  load failure, or a delivery failure for one owner is logged (owner id and
  host only) and the pass continues to the next owner.

### Timezone behavior

Each owner's "today" is evaluated in:

1. **The owner's own persisted timezone**, if one is set (captured
   automatically from the owner's browser) — this is preferred.
2. Otherwise, the **server's local timezone** — resolved from the `TZ`
   environment variable (default `Local`, i.e. whatever the host/container's
   local timezone is) — as a fallback for owners with no persisted timezone.

In a household with owners in different timezones who have each had their
timezone captured, each owner's reminders are decided against their own local
calendar day, not the server's. If you run the pass (or the built-in
scheduler) once daily at a server-local hour and most or all of your owners
have not yet had their timezone captured, that hour is effectively "09:00
server time" for everyone until each owner's browser records its timezone.

The [calendar feed](#3-calendar-ics-subscription) resolves "today" by the same
two rules, so a prediction never lands on different days in the two channels;
its fallback is the timezone of the request that fetched it, which for a
calendar client (it sends no browser timezone) is the server's local timezone.

### Security notes

Operator-relevant summary (the full, test-backed claim list lives in
[`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md) and
[`SECURITY.md` → Webhook Notifications (outbound egress)](../SECURITY.md#webhook-notifications-outbound-egress)):

- **SSRF stance — LAN allowed by design.** The webhook URL is fully
  owner-controlled, and self-hosted ntfy/Gotify/Apprise instances commonly live
  on the same LAN as the Ovumcy host. Private, loopback, and link-local
  addresses are **allowed by default** so that setup works out of the box.
  Instead of blocking the destination, the request envelope itself is
  hardened: a 10-second hard timeout, no connection keep-alive/pooling, zero
  redirects, a capped response read, and `http`/`https` schemes only.
- **Optional hardening.** Set `WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES=true` (default:
  `false`) to refuse delivery to loopback/private/link-local targets, and to any
  other address the IANA special-purpose registries record as not globally
  reachable (benchmarking, documentation, reserved and multicast space among
  them). Leave it
  unset/`false` for the common self-hosted-on-LAN case (a webhook URL like
  `http://ntfy.local` or `http://192.168.1.20:8080/...`). Turn it on only if
  your threat model specifically requires blocking private-network egress from
  the notify pass. Multi-owner household instances and publicly reachable
  deployments are the typical such case — enabling it stops one owner from using
  the shared host's notify pass to probe another service on the private network.
  When on, the check covers both IP-literal hosts **and**
  hostnames that resolve to a private address: the destination is resolved,
  refused if any resolved record is private, and then the connection is made to
  that exact validated IP (so a hostname cannot rebind to a private address
  after the check); a lookup failure fails closed. "Private" here spans RFC 1918,
  ULA, loopback, link-local, the unspecified address, RFC 6598 CGNAT
  (`100.64.0.0/10`), RFC 1122 "this network" (`0.0.0.0/8`), the deprecated IPv6
  site-local range (`fec0::/10`), and the RFC 8215 local-use NAT64 block
  (`64:ff9b:1::/48`).

  It also spans the IPv6 forms that carry an IPv4 address *inside* them. On a
  network that routes such a form the packet ends up at the embedded IPv4, so the
  embedded address decides the verdict, not the IPv6 wrapper: `[2002:7f00:1::]`
  is `127.0.0.1` written differently, and it is refused. The decoded forms are
  RFC 6052 NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`), 6to4 (`2002::/16`), Teredo (`2001::/32`),
  IPv4-compatible (`::/96`) and IPv4-translated (`::ffff:0:0:0/96`). A form
  wrapping a **public** IPv4 stays allowed, since that is where it really
  routes. This same flag applies to both the CLI pass and the built-in
  scheduler. The server also logs a startup warning when `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`
  is combined with `WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES=false`, surfacing exactly this
  multi-owner / publicly-reachable exposure at boot.
- **Cloud deployments: turn hardening on.** The default above (LAN allowed) is
  meant for self-hosting on a home/office network. On a cloud VM
  (AWS/GCP/Azure/etc.) the link-local range also reaches the instance **metadata
  service** (`169.254.169.254`), which — like any other private target — an
  owner-controlled webhook URL would let the notify pass POST to. Delivery only
  sends a fixed body (JSON, or ntfy plain text) and discards the (size-capped)
  response, so there is no
  response-body exfiltration path; the residual risk is a semi-trusted owner using
  status/timing differences to probe the instance's own internal network (a
  *blind* SSRF). If you deploy Ovumcy to any cloud or otherwise non-LAN host, set
  `WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES=true` — the resolve-and-pin check above then
  refuses loopback/private/link-local targets, including the metadata endpoint,
  with DNS-rebinding protection.
- **Host-only logging.** Every log line the delivery path emits — success,
  failure, or skip — includes at most the destination **hostname**, never the
  full URL, path, query string, or userinfo.
- **Disclaimer in every payload.** Every delivered JSON body includes a
  `disclaimer` field carrying the exact medical-safety string shown elsewhere
  in the app: *"Predictions are estimates, not medical advice or a method of
  contraception."* — in the owner's own interface language, the same one the
  title and message are written in. An ntfy-format body (`?format=ntfy`, below)
  ends with the same string, after the message and a blank line.
- **URL encrypted at rest.** The stored webhook URL is AES-256-GCM ciphertext,
  bound to the owning user's id, exactly like a TOTP secret. If `SECRET_KEY`
  is rotated, existing stored URLs can no longer be decrypted; delivery fails
  safe and skips that owner (no delivery to a garbage target) until the owner
  re-saves their URL under the new key. See the *SECRET_KEY Usage Map* in
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for the full rotation impact table.
- **No secrets in the payload or CLI output.** The JSON payload carries only a
  title, message, the disclaimer, the reminder type, the estimated event date
  (and its last day, when the estimate is a range), and the lead-day count (the
  ntfy format sends a subset: title, message, disclaimer and a tag for the
  type) — never the webhook URL, never `SECRET_KEY`, never a health specific
  beyond the estimated date or range. The CLI never prints the URL
  or the token at all, and by default prints no reminder type or estimated date
  either; `ovumcy notify --dry-run --show-health-details` is the one way to ask
  for those, and it is opt-in precisely because the answer is health data.

#### Payload shape

```json
{
  "title": "Period reminder",
  "message": "Estimated next period around 2026-07-14.",
  "disclaimer": "Predictions are estimates, not medical advice or a method of contraception.",
  "type": "period-soon",
  "event_date": "2026-07-14",
  "lead_days": 3
}
```

`type` is machine-readable (`period-soon` or `ovulation-soon`) so a downstream
consumer (an ntfy topic rule, a Gotify filter, a home-automation flow) can
route on it without parsing `message`. `disclaimer` is present on every
payload, unconditionally.

When the app shows the estimate as a range rather than one day, the payload
adds `event_date_end`, the range's last day, and `event_date` is its first
day; `message` then names both (*"Next period estimated to start between
2026-07-11 and 2026-07-17."*). A single-date reminder has no `event_date_end`.
A range reminder is sent once, when the range comes within the lead window.

#### ntfy-native delivery (`?format=ntfy`)

ntfy renders a plain-body `POST` to a topic URL **verbatim as the
notification text**, so the JSON envelope above arrives on an ntfy topic as a
raw JSON blob. If your webhook URL is an ntfy topic, opt that one URL into
ntfy-native formatting by appending `format=ntfy` to it:

```
https://ntfy.example.com/my-topic?format=ntfy
```

Delivery then sends what ntfy expects natively:

- `X-Title` — the reminder title (the same localized `title` as the JSON field;
  a non-ASCII title travels as an RFC 2047 encoded word, which ntfy decodes),
- `X-Tags` — an emoji tag per kind (`drop_of_blood` 🩸 for a period reminder,
  `sparkles` ✨ for ovulation),
- a `text/plain` body of the localized `message`, a blank line, then the
  `disclaimer` — the disclaimer is delivered on every notification in this
  format too, unconditionally.

Everything else about the URL passes through untouched: an access token in
the query (`?auth=...`) or userinfo still applies (ntfy ignores the unknown
`format` parameter), and all delivery hardening (timeouts, no redirects,
host-only logging) is identical in both formats. URLs without `format=ntfy`
keep the generic JSON envelope byte-for-byte, so Gotify, Apprise, and
home-automation consumers are unaffected. Re-saving the URL in Settings (or
`ovumcy webhook set`) is all it takes to switch a given endpoint between the
two formats. ntfy parameters you add to the URL yourself are yours to answer
for: `filename=`, `attach=` or `template=` can make ntfy render the body as an
attachment or through a template, where the disclaimer line may not be shown.

The three text fields — `title`, `message` and `disclaimer` — are written in the
**interface language the owner chose in settings**, all three in the same one
(the example above is an owner on English). A pass runs without a browser, so
the stored language is the only thing that knows which one to use, exactly as
the stored timezone is the only thing that knows which calendar day the owner is
on. An owner who never picked a language gets the server default
(`DEFAULT_LANGUAGE`). `type`, `event_date` and `lead_days` never change with the
language — route on those, not on the prose.

## 3. Calendar (.ics) subscription

An owner can generate a private, read-only calendar feed URL and subscribe to
it from any standard calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar,
Thunderbird, or any client that supports "subscribe by URL"). The feed shows
estimated period and ovulation days and updates automatically each time the
calendar app refreshes it — there is nothing to schedule or run.

Besides the projected days, the feed carries the current cycle's
temperature-confirmed ovulation day: once a basal body temperature shift
confirms ovulation, that day appears in the feed exactly when the dashboard and
the calendar show it, including after a cycle has run so long that projected
dates are paused. It is still an estimate and carries the same disclaimer. If
the feed had already projected ovulation for that same day, the calendar app
updates that event rather than adding a second one; a projected day the
confirmation replaces is dropped. The confirmed day is withheld in irregular
(unpredictable) cycle mode, during a pregnancy pause and before the first
completed cycle, as it is in the app, and earlier cycles are never included.
Webhook reminders stay future-only and never send a confirmed day.

The feed and the webhook reminders name dates the way the dashboard does.
Where the dashboard shows a next-period start window (three or more completed
cycles that vary in length) or, in irregular cycle mode, an ovulation range, the
feed carries that window as one multi-day event and the reminder names its first
and last day — never the single middle day the window was built around. With
irregular cycle mode on and fewer than three completed cycles, the dashboard
says more cycles are needed instead of naming a date, and the feed and the
reminders send no projected date at all. A regular account with fewer than
three completed cycles gets no ovulation event and no ovulation reminder
either; its next-period estimate is still sent.

### How to enable it

On the Settings page, under **Calendar feed**:

1. Click **Generate feed link**. Ovumcy creates a private subscribe URL and
   shows it to you **exactly once**, on a dedicated confirmation page — copy
   it immediately, since it cannot be redisplayed later.
2. Paste that URL into your calendar app's "subscribe to calendar by URL" (or
   equivalent) feature.
3. If you suspect the URL leaked, click **Rotate link** to mint a fresh URL —
   the previous one stops working immediately. To turn the feed off entirely,
   click **Turn off feed** — any previously issued URL then 404s.

The feed is **read-only**: nothing a calendar app does can write back into
Ovumcy through it. It is scoped to the single owner who generated it, exactly
like every other per-day and per-account resource in Ovumcy.

Turning the feed off, rotating the link or clearing your data stops the
calendar app from fetching anything new, but the app keeps the last copy it
fetched. That copy can include a past, temperature-confirmed ovulation day. To
remove those events, also delete the subscription in the calendar app itself.

### Security rationale (brief)

The subscribe URL itself is the credential — a calendar client sends no
session cookie — so it is treated as a bearer capability token, not a normal
authenticated resource: it is generated with cryptographic randomness, stored
only as a hashed verifier (never recoverable from the database), shown to the
owner exactly once, and revocable at any time by rotating or turning the feed
off. The stored verifier is keyed by `SECRET_KEY`, so **rotating that secret
disarms every armed feed**: current rows refuse outright (their keyed MAC no
longer matches), rows armed before migration 032 are disarmed by a boot-time
rotation check, and subscribed calendar clients start receiving `404` until
each owner generates a fresh subscribe URL from Settings. Plan a secret
rotation accordingly — it is the same class of consequence rotation already has
for 2FA secrets and stored webhook URLs. The full rationale and test-backed
invariants live in
[`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md) under **Calendar feed
subscription** — see that section for the complete, current detail rather than
this summary.
