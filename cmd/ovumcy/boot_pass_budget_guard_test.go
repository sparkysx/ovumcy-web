// the guard reads that window out of main()'s own body and holds whatever it
// finds there to the budget. A pass added to the window later is covered
// without anyone remembering to extend a list — including one wired behind a
// config flag, since collectBootPassCalls descends into nested blocks. What it
// does not claim to cover is written on that function, and the floor below is
// what keeps the gap from reading as success.
//
// The floor matters as much as the rule: a sweep that reached nothing and a

// than the passes known to live there, the guard fails as unable to have
