// user.CreatedAt) where the in-location calendar day is what you want.
//
// Do NOT use this for date-only stored values (DailyLog.Date,
// User.LastPeriodStart). Those values carry only a calendar date — their
// time-of-day and timezone metadata are storage artifacts. Applying
// In(location) to a UTC-midnight stored value in a UTC-minus locale shifts

// the same reason it exists: the reminder scheduler resolves the day of its
// daily pass the same way, and a second implementation of this rule is how
// the class of defects it fixes comes back.
//
// `location` must not be nil — every caller resolves that first (the wrappers
// below and reminders.nextRun default it to UTC).
//
// Plain time.Date cannot be used directly: in a UTC-minus zone whose DST jump
// lands exactly on midnight (America/Santiago, America/Havana), local midnight
// does not exist and time.Date resolves the nonexistent wall clock through its
// `utc >= end` branch, which normalizes BACKWARD into the previous calendar
// day — the spring-forward date could then not be entered at all. Positive
// offsets take the `utc < start` branch and normalize forward within the same

// are zones without transitions (UTC included): the fallback below only fires

// `day.AddDate(0, 0, n)` is not that. AddDate re-enters time.Date in the

// skipped, and the result is resolved back into `location` through the single
// construction point. Keeping the caller's anchor is deliberate: these values
// are routinely ordered against other location-midnight values, and returning a
