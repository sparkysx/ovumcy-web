### Security

- **Flooding the attempt limiter no longer lifts a lockout or erases another budget.** The
  in-memory `AttemptLimiter` behind every per-account budget (login, recovery, TOTP, settings
  re-authentication) bounds its own memory: a periodic sweep drops entries whose window has lapsed,
  and above 1024 entries the coldest are evicted. Both bounds judged every entry by the budget of
  whichever failure triggered them. A login failure's sweep therefore erased a recovery lockout
  forty minutes before its own hour lapsed, and 1025 fresh login identities — the login form
  accepts any email — evicted the coldest entries first, which is exactly a locked-out victim,
  since the lockout is what stopped the attacker from touching that key; the same flood reached
  a partially spent TOTP budget. Every entry now carries the scope, limit and window it was
  recorded under: the sweep uses each entry's own window, the cap is enforced per scope, and an
  entry at its limit — an active lockout — is pinned until it expires. Regressions:

- **A spent per-account logout budget no longer keeps a session alive.** `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/current`
  checked the per-account logout budget before revoking the session, so once the budget was spent
  the owner could not sign out at all — on a shared device the session stayed usable until the
  window lapsed. The revoke and the cookie retraction now come first and the budget check second:
  a refused sign-out still ends the session and answers `429` (a browser form is sent to the
  sign-in page with the refusal as a flash) with the cookies already gone; what it withholds is
  the provider sign-out bridge. The per-IP `RATE_LIMIT_LOGOUT_*` row on `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/current` is
  edge middleware and still refuses before the handler runs, so whoever shares the address and
  spends that row holds an API client's sign-out until its window lapses; the browser form
  (`POST /logout`) is not behind that row. The budget stays keyed on the **owner** and deliberately does not
  name the session: revoking bumps the account's session version, so no session reaches the route
  twice and a session-keyed budget would record one attempt per key and never trip, leaving the
  browser sign-out route with no account-side cap. What the session used to carry is instead fixed
  in the client bucket, now `(address, account)` rather than the address by itself, which had run a
  second per-address cap of 20 under the documented per-IP row of 60 and refused a household's — or
  a test run's — 21st sign-out from one address. A logout is recorded
  against this budget only — never as a failure against, nor a reset of, the login, recovery or
  TOTP budgets. Regressions:
  `TestLogoutRevokesTheSessionBeforeTheBudgetIsChecked`,
  `TestLogoutBudgetIsKeyedByTheOwnerNotTheSession`,
  `TestLogoutBudgetIsSpendableAcrossSuccessiveSessions`,
  `TestLogoutAccountingNeverTouchesAnotherBudget`.
- **Every `RATE_LIMIT_*` setting has a ceiling.** A `*_MAX` accepted any positive integer and a
  `*_WINDOW` any duration of a second or more, so `RATE_LIMIT_LOGIN_MAX=100000000` switched the
  sign-in limiter off and a window of a year kept a refused address refused until restart. Each
  `*_MAX` now has a ceiling — 100 for login, registration and password reset (each request costs
  a bcrypt compare), 600 for the per-IP logout row, 200 for the per-account logout budget, 3000
  for the API catch-all and 120 for the calendar feed — and each `*_WINDOW` must lie between one
  second and one day. A value outside its range is logged at boot and the default is used, as an
  unparseable value already was. Operators who had set a `*_MAX` above its ceiling get the default
  from this release; on the three credential endpoints a shorter window does not widen the budget
  either (see the 30-requests-per-minute rate ceiling entry). The bcrypt cost stays the load-bearing limit and is unchanged.
