//
//	ALTER TABLE t RENAME TO t_old; CREATE TABLE t (…);
//	INSERT INTO t SELECT … FROM t_old; DROP TABLE t_old; -- the rename-first form
//
// The second narrows t exactly as the first does, and a check keyed on the
// dropped name sees nothing: t_old does not exist yet when the snapshot is
// taken, and t is never dropped at all. Reading the whole schema is what makes
// the guard about the effect instead of about the spelling.

//	ALTER TABLE t DROP COLUMN c            -- the column is retired
//	ALTER TABLE t RENAME COLUMN c TO other -- the column is still there, renamed
//
// A rename is not a loss: the values are under the new name, and refusing it
// would have the guard reporting a data loss that did not happen, which is the
// mirror of the defect it exists to catch. Only the OLD name of the statement
// is accounted for — renaming one column says nothing about the rest of the
// table, so a rebuild that quietly drops a second column is still refused.
//
// The `TO` clause is what separates a column rename from a TABLE rename:
// `ALTER TABLE t RENAME TO t_old` has no name before the TO and therefore
// matches nothing here, which matters because that statement is the first half
// of the rename-first rebuild idiom and must never authorize anything.
