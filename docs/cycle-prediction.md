# Cycle prediction — how the math works

This document describes, in full, how ovumcy estimates ovulation, the fertile
window, and the next period. It exists so that anyone — users, contributors,
auditors — can read exactly what the app computes and verify it against the
code. It covers what is computed; whether a given estimate is *shown* is a
separate gate, and the one that withholds the whole fertility half until the
account completes three cycles is described under "Early cycles" below.
The worked examples below are mirrored 1:1 by automated reference tests
(`internal/services/cycles_reference_test.go`), so the documentation and the
implementation cannot silently drift apart.

## Inputs

| Input | Meaning | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `periodStart` | First day of the current menstrual period (cycle day 1) | Where a cycle starts, by the rule below |
| `cycleLength` | Length of the cycle in days | Median of observed cycles, or the user's configured value |
| `lutealPhase` | Days that **follow** ovulation, up to and including the day before the next period | **14-day** default, refined toward the owner's own value from logged BBT / cervical-mucus signals when enough cycles carry them |

## Where a cycle starts

One rule decides it, and every surface reads the same answer: the count of
completed cycles, their lengths, the last period start, the dashboard's cycle
day, the calendar's "recorded" day, the stats insights and the luteal-phase
inference. Two screens cannot disagree about the same history.

Period days that sit fewer than five clear days apart form one bleeding
episode. An episode opens a cycle when it has any of:

- two or more consecutive non-spotting period days;
- a non-spotting day the owner marked as a cycle start (and did not mark as
  uncertain);
- a lone non-spotting period day dated today or yesterday — the period may still
  be running. It stops counting once a later day passes without a second period
  day.

The cycle starts on the earliest qualifying day of the episode, and an explicit
mark wins over the run. Spotting never opens a cycle, even when marked: a day
whose flow is spotting, or whose only bleeding signal is the Spotting symptom
with no flow chosen. A lone bleeding day that qualifies under none of the above
starts no cycle and does not split the cycle around it. An episode whose only
mark is "uncertain" is held back the same way. A history that records each
period as a single unmarked day older than yesterday therefore holds no cycles
for those periods; marking each such day as a cycle start restores them.

The start date stored at onboarding (the last period start) is a boundary of its
own. It joins the grouping as a marked, non-spotting day, so a logged episode it
falls inside or adjoins yields one start, not two. A start dated in the future is
ignored. Un-ticking the period on the start date, or deleting that day, clears
the stored start. A start day with no entry shows its period ticked in the day
editor and in the dashboard's Today form, and each form posts a hidden field
saying the tick came from the stored start; saving either form unticked clears
the start too. Saving it with the box still ticked, adding a mood or a symptom
to a non-period entry there, or a JSON write of that date without the period
(which never showed the tick) leaves it in place. Moving the start in Settings
writes the new start's days as onboarding would, through the period's last day
or the owner's local today, whichever comes first. When auto-fill is on in the
stored settings and the move corrects the old date — the old start still opens
the newest cycle and the new one is earlier, or less than a shortest cycle (15
days) later — it also removes the days the old start's fill wrote: the run from
the old start that one fill write produced, stopping at the first day that is
missing, carries anything the owner entered, or was written by another save.
Only a fill written as one cohort of at least two days is removed: unless the
old start and the day after it share one write, nothing goes. So a period day
ticked by hand is never removed, a period length of 1 is never cleared, an
onboarding completed on its own start day wrote that one day only and keeps it, and an
install onboarded before this release (whose fill carries a stamp per day)
keeps its old days on a move, as it did before. Otherwise the old fill would
remain a boundary of its own and leave a phantom short cycle. A later move keeps
the old days as history.
An export over a requested range omits the stored start when
it lies outside that range.

The pregnancy pause reads the same rule without the today-or-yesterday
allowance: a positive test pauses predictions until a boundary falls on a later
calendar day, so a marked start or an unmarked two-day bleed lifts it, while a
single bleeding day (even one dated today), a spotting day or an uncertain mark
does not.

## The model

The model rests on one physiological assumption: **the luteal phase (the days
after ovulation, up to the next period) is relatively stable per person** —
modelled at ~14 days by default, and refined toward the owner's own value when
logged signals allow — while the follicular phase (period → ovulation) absorbs
the variation in cycle length. So ovulation is counted *backwards* from the next
expected period.

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| `defaultLutealPhaseDays` | 14 | Default luteal phase, used when it is not refined from logged signals |
| `minLutealPhaseDays` | 10 | Lower clamp for the luteal phase (engineering heuristic, not a clinical boundary) |
| `minOvulationCycleDay` | 5 | Ovulation may not fall before cycle day 5 |
| (min cycle for a prediction) | 15 | `minLutealPhaseDays + minOvulationCycleDay` |

### Step 1 — resolve the luteal phase

```
luteal ≤ 0          → 14   (default)
0 < luteal < 10     → 10   (minimum)
luteal ≥ 10         → luteal
```

### Step 2 — ovulation day (1-based, within the cycle)

```
if cycleLength < 15:                      no prediction
maxSupportedLuteal = cycleLength − 5
if resolvedLuteal > maxSupportedLuteal:   resolvedLuteal = maxSupportedLuteal   (prediction marked non-exact)
ovulationDay = cycleLength − resolvedLuteal
if ovulationDay < 5:                      no prediction
```

`periodStart` is cycle day 1, so the ovulation **date** is
`periodStart + (ovulationDay − 1)` days.

### Step 2a — the same arithmetic, run backwards

Personalization travels this arithmetic in the other direction: an ovulation
*observed* from logged signals is turned back into the `lutealPhase` the step
above consumes. That is Step 2 solved for the luteal phase, and nothing more:

```
observedLuteal = cycleLength − observedOvulationDay
```

Both directions have to use one indexing, or an observation trains a value that
predicts a different day than the one observed. What using one buys:

> An ovulation observed on cycle day **N** predicts cycle day **N** again on a
> next cycle of the same length — unless the luteal phase that observation
> implies no longer fits the cycle, in which case Step 2's clamp applies and the
> prediction is marked non-exact.

The exception is not hypothetical, so the table below carries a row for it: on a
15-day cycle an ovulation observed on day 4 implies an 11-day luteal phase, which
is physiologically ordinary and still more than that cycle can hold, and the
reserve clamp is what stops the estimate from landing before cycle day 5. The
table is asserted row for row by
`TestLutealPhaseRoundTrip_ReferenceVectors`. The invariant itself is a claim
about the *observation* path, so it is pinned where that path runs, by
`TestInferredLutealPhaseRoundTripsThroughPrediction` and
`TestInferredLutealPhaseReachesTheOwnerSurfacesThroughTheBaseline`: those read an
ovulation out of logged temperature or mucus entries and follow it all the way to
a rendered date. A test of the two formulas alone could never have caught the
drift, and not by oversight: they are exact inverses by construction, so the pair
always agrees. What drifted was a third thing — the step that read an ovulation
out of the logs and worked out which argument to hand them.

| cycleLength | observed ovulation | → lutealPhase | → predicted ovulation |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 28 | day 14 | 14 (the model default) | day 14 |
| 28 | day 15 | 13 | day 15 |
| 21 | day 8  | 13 | day 8  |
| 35 | day 21 | 14 | day 21 |
| 40 | day 26 | 14 | day 26 |
| 30 | day 20 | 10 (equal to the floor, not clamped to it) | day 20 |
| 15 | day 4  | 11, clamped to 10 by Step 2 | day 5 (non-exact) |

The parameter counts the days that *follow* ovulation, so it is one day shorter
than the calendar span from the ovulation date to the next period start — that
span counts the ovulation day itself. Measuring that span and feeding it back in
as the parameter moved every personalized prediction one day early, the
ovulation date and both fertile-window edges alike.

### Step 3 — fertile window

The fertile window is the **6-day range ending on ovulation day**, reflecting
that sperm can survive several days and the egg is viable for about a day:

```
fertilityEnd   = ovulationDate
fertilityStart = ovulationDate − 5 days
if fertilityStart < periodStart:  fertilityStart = periodStart   (short-cycle clamp)
```

On short cycles the window may overlap menstruation; it is never allowed to
start before the period.

**Irregular range mode — the current cycle only.** An account with
irregular-cycle mode on and at least three completed cycles is shown a range of
possible ovulation days, so its current cycle's window is widened to cover that
range: it runs from the shortest recent cycle's window start to the longest
recent cycle's ovulation day, each placed by the same arithmetic as above.

```
fertilityStart = window(minCycleLength).fertilityStart   (clamp included; periodStart
                                                          when no ovulation fits)
fertilityEnd   = window(maxCycleLength).ovulationDate
```

The published ovulation date stays the median one, so it can sit in the middle
of this window. On the days after it, up to the window's last day, no phase is
named (the phase is `unknown`): the ovulation may still be ahead, and "luteal"
would say it is behind. A day with bleeding logged on it stays `menstrual` —
a recorded fact outranks the rule. The window can run past the projected next period;
it is not cut there, and the calendar marks those days as both. The projected
cycles chained after the current one keep the median window — a projection of a
projection is not widened.

### Step 4 — next period

```
nextPeriodStart = periodStart + cycleLength days
```

A prediction is only returned when the ovulation date falls strictly before the
next period start.

## Worked examples

These are the exact cases asserted by the reference tests.

| any | 14 | any | — | — | — | no prediction (cycle too short) |

## How cycle length and luteal phase are chosen

- **Cycle length** is the median of the owner's recent observed cycles (a cycle
  being the gap between two detected period starts). The median is used rather
  than the mean, so a single missed-log gap that merges two cycles cannot skew
  the estimate. When there is not enough history, the owner's configured value
  is used — for the next-period estimate only; see "Early cycles" below.
- **Luteal phase** defaults to the fixed 14-day model value, but is refined for
  the owner when their logs carry enough signal: when basal body temperature or
  cervical-mucus entries place the ovulation inside past cycles, each of those
  observations becomes a luteal length by Step 2a and the average of them
  replaces the default. A cycle whose inferred luteal length falls outside a
  10–20 day window is **discarded** from that average rather than pulled to the
  nearest edge of it, and the refinement needs at least two surviving cycles, so
  a single odd reading cannot move the estimate on its own. That window is an
  engineering outlier filter over *inferred* lengths, not a clinical boundary:
  luteal phases at or below its floor occur and are ordinary — a TTC cohort
  anchored on ovulation tests put 18 % of cycles at 11 days or fewer counting
  the ovulation day itself, which is 10 or fewer on the count this document
  uses, which excludes it — so a discarded sample is one this inference declines
  to average, never a measurement shown to be wrong and never a statement about
  the owner's body. The cervical-mucus signal estimates ovulation as the day
  after the last egg-white (peak-quality) mucus day of the cycle; self-observed
  peak days can differ from reference ovulation by a day or more, which is
  another reason the inferred luteal length stays an estimate. With little or no
  such data, or with fewer than two surviving samples, the fixed 14-day default
  stands — it is the model's constant, not a value observed from this owner, and
  no surface may present it as evidence of a personalised luteal phase.
  Individual luteal phases vary (commonly 11–17 days), which is one reason
  predictions remain estimates.
- For irregular cycles the app widens the prediction into a range rather than a
  single date. The range and variability statistics (shortest/longest cycle and
  the sample standard deviation) are computed over the same recent-cycle window
  as the median, so an old outlier cycle stops affecting them once it ages out
  of the window. The ovulation range runs from the ovulation date the model
  places in the shortest of those cycles to the one it places in the longest —
  the same arithmetic as a single projected date, applied once per end — so it
  agrees with the calendar, the feed and the reminders for the same cycle
  length. When the shortest observed cycle is under 15 days — too short for the
  model to place an ovulation — the range starts at the earliest ovulation the
  model ever names (cycle day 5). Earlier versions derived the range by shifting
  the next-period range back by the luteal phase, which put that start before
  cycle day 1 for such a history.

### How a BBT temperature shift is detected (the "3-over-6" coverline rule)

Basal body temperature rises ~0.2–0.5 °C after ovulation (progesterone from the
corpus luteum is thermogenic), so a sustained rise *confirms ovulation
retrospectively*. One shared detector drives every surface that names an
ovulation day: the luteal-phase inference, the calendar's ovulation markers
(dashed only while BBT tracking is on and no confirmed shift is shown yet; the
solid dot marks a confirmed day, but is also drawn for projected future cycles,
for phases derived from logged period starts, and for the whole current cycle
when temperature tracking is off — so a solid dot alone is not a confirmation),
the dashboard's
ovulation line, the JSON overview's `ovulation_date` / `ovulation_confirmed`,
and the coverline + probable-ovulation marker on the stats BBT chart. For the
current cycle the calendar, the dashboard and the JSON overview read one
resolver and the chart shares its detection window, so a shift names one day
wherever it is shown; the chart is the one surface that keeps its marker while
the others withhold every date (an overdue cycle, unpredictable mode, a
pregnancy pause, the first cycle). That window runs through the owner's today
rather than to the projected next-period start — a shift that arrives after the
projected date has passed is still this cycle's. The rule applied is the
classical symptothermal ("3-over-6") one:

- **Coverline** — the maximum of the **6 immediately preceding** recorded,
  undisturbed temperatures. The maximum (not the mean) is used so ordinary
  follicular-phase noise cannot slip past the threshold.
- **Shift** — **3 calendar-consecutive** recorded days all strictly above the
  coverline, with the **third day at least 0.2 °C above** it.
- **Ovulation estimate** — the calendar day **before** the first elevated day
  (the rise follows ovulation by about a day).
- **Disturbance exclusion** — readings on days tagged with the `illness` or
  `sleep_disruption` cycle factors are excluded from the detection series
  entirely: a fever or short-sleep reading must neither inflate the coverline
  (masking a real shift) nor count as an elevated day (faking one). This is the
  single sanctioned case where daily cycle factors influence a computation —
  they still never alter the calendar prediction formulas above.
- With fewer than 6 undisturbed readings before a candidate day, or without a
  qualifying 3-day run, no shift is reported: the chart draws no coverline and
  no marker, and the luteal inference falls back to the cervical-mucus signal
  or the 14-day default.

**What this detector is not.** The rule above is the *temperature* half of a
symptothermal method, applied to recorded, undisturbed readings. It is not the
full fertility-awareness protocol those methods define, and the differences are
deliberate rather than gaps:

- **No double-check against a second indicator.** Symptothermal protocols
  confirm a thermal shift against cervical mucus or the cervix before treating
  it as a change of phase. Here the temperature rule stands alone; the
  cervical-mucus signal is a separate fallback estimate used when no shift is
  found, never a cross-check on one that was.
- **No slow-rise exception — the detector is stricter.** Reference methods
  carry exception rules that rescue a rise whose third day misses the 0.2 °C
  margin, by waiting for a fourth day that only has to stay above the coverline.
  This detector has none. What decides a candidate is how far its third day
  stands above the coverline, not how large a single step was: three days
  climbing 0.1 °C each do confirm over a flat window, because the third of them
  is 0.3 °C above it. What is never rescued is a rise that falls short on its
  third day and keeps climbing afterwards — the coverline is recomputed for each
  candidate from the six recordings before it, so those first elevated readings
  join the window the later days are measured against and lift the bar to their
  own level.
- **A disturbed day is dropped whole.** An `illness` or `sleep_disruption` tag
  removes the reading from the detection series without asking whether its value
  actually stands out from its neighbours — broader than the reference method's
  bracketing of a single outlying value, and the reason a tagged day does not
  occupy a slot in the six either.
- **The six are recordings, not calendar days.** A morning left unrecorded
  lengthens the window backwards instead of shrinking it, and any number of gaps
  is tolerated; a published implementation that scores the window over calendar
  days (Zhu et al., 2021) allows one missing day of six and no more.

The reference method in the first three points is Sensiplan (Arbeitsgruppe
NFP), and its rules are taken from secondary accounts: the handbook *Natürlich
und sicher* was not consulted, so those differences are stated against the
accounts, not quoted from the method's text. The method's effectiveness study is
Frank-Herrmann et al., *Hum Reprod* 2007;22(5):1310–1319,
doi:10.1093/humrep/dem003. The last point compares against Zhu et al. (2021)
directly.

The date it produces is an inference from a signal, not an observation of
ovulation: the day before the first elevated reading. Prospective work comparing
home temperature records against an LH-anchored reference finds that first
elevated reading follows the anchor by days on average (Zhu et al., *JMIR
mHealth and uHealth*, 2021: 2.7 ± 1.9 days after LH+1 in that cohort). A
confirmed shift therefore says an ovulation has already happened — it is not a
forecast, and not a method of contraception.

The stats chart draws the coverline only once a shift is confirmed — until then
there is nothing physiologically meaningful to draw. Even a confirmed shift
remains an estimate, never a fact, and no individual accuracy interval is
promised: the day is inferred from the signal, and, as above, the first elevated
reading lags the LH-anchored day by days on average. Treat the marker as
indicative, not diagnostic.

## Early cycles — what is computed but not shown

The math above runs from the first day logged, but a projection whose only source
is the onboarding cycle-length slider is a configuration default wearing the
clothes of a measurement, and one built from one or two observed lengths is a
single data point or the midpoint of two. Until the account completes **three**
cycles (`CompletedCycleCount >= 3` — the same count the stats page reports as
"based on N completed cycles"; regular and irregular mode share the number), the
whole fertility half of the projection is withheld. With no completed cycle the
wire reason is `awaiting_first_cycle`; with one or two in regular mode it is
`awaiting_more_cycles` (irregular mode keeps `irregular_needs_more_cycles`, which
also withholds the next period). What is withheld:

- the ovulation date, the fertile window and the peak-fertility band on the
  calendar grid;
- the ovulation events in the `.ics` feed;
- the ovulation reminder in the webhook pass;
- the ovulation banner on the dashboard.

The ribbon's phase labels after menstruation withhold the same way. The floor
withholds projections only: past completed cycles keep their inferred shading under
the "show historical phases" setting.
The next-period estimate survives this floor, with its own estimate qualifier —
its anchor is a date the owner actually recorded.

Three further signals withhold **every** projected date, the next period included,
on every one of those surfaces: unpredictable-cycle mode (the settings toggle
"My cycle is unpredictable"), a pregnancy pause, and a cycle overdue past its own
cycle length — more than a week past it, a margin that is an explicitly named
engineering safety rule rather than a clinical cutoff: no guideline says a
prediction becomes invalid on a particular cycle day, and past that point the
projected period is more than a week behind today and the model has nothing
later to offer but a whole-cycle roll, so what it would yield is manufactured
rather than estimated.

That comparison uses the **shorter** of the two cycle lengths: the median-first
projection length every published date is projected from, and the
average-first reference length. The average alone cannot carry the decision. A
period that was never logged merges two cycles into one 300-day gap, which leaves
the median at 28 and pulls the average of three ordinary cycles to 96, and a rule
measured against 96 withheld nothing on cycle day 61 while every date it published
came from the 28. The median alone cannot carry it either: where the median sits
above the average (28/60/60 — median 60, average 49) it would keep dates published
to cycle day 67 while the out-of-date-data notice, which reads the average with no
week of grace, has stood since day 50. Taking the shorter length withholds no later
than either statistic would, keeps the days on which that notice stands beside a
published date to seven at most, and settles the merged span without ruling on
which spans still count as a cycle. The late-cycle notice follows the same length;
the dashboard's cycle ribbon is not drawn at all past the gate, because its axis
length, its start window and its "today" marker are all projection output. The
out-of-date-data notice keeps the displayed reference length. Nothing recorded is
discarded: the merged span stays in the history, and logging the missing period
corrects it.

The same gate covers the two places a projected window is read outside those
surfaces: the day-save message no longer calls a day fertile from a withheld window,
and logging a new cycle start no longer offers the implantation-bleeding hint counted
from a withheld ovulation. Both read the fertility gate, so unpredictable-cycle mode,
a pregnancy pause and the three-cycle floor withhold them too — the hint states a
number of days since ovulation, and below three completed cycles that ovulation is
the configured cycle length, or one or two observed lengths, rolled forward, which
is an inference no reader could tell from a measurement. One value outlives
it: an ovulation day the owner's own temperatures confirmed. It was never rolled
forward from the length that ran out,
so the dashboard line, the calendar's solid marker and the JSON overview keep
naming it — still worded as an estimate, beside the disclaimer — while the fertile
window and fertility status derived from it stay withheld. Unpredictable-cycle mode,
a pregnancy pause and the zero-completed-cycle floor still withhold that day too;
the one-or-two-cycle tier of a regular account does not, as the thin-history tier
of irregular mode does not — it exists because a projection has too few observed
lengths, and a day read off the owner's own temperatures is not a projection.

The day-save message adds one more condition of its own: the fertile line is spoken only
when the saved day is today (in the owner's timezone). A day the owner records after the
fact, or a day still ahead, answers the plain "Saved." message even when it sits inside
the window the current cycle projects.

The floor is the fourth signal and the only partial one. Predicates:
`FertilityProjectionSuppressed` over `PredictionsSuppressed`
(`internal/services/dashboard_cycle.go`) — one predicate rather than a copy per
surface, precisely because the floor had once been missed at one of four sites.
All five surfaces — the calendar grid, the `.ics` feed, the webhook reminder, the
dashboard reminder banner and the implantation hint — are pinned by
`TestFirstCycleFloorSuppressesFertilityOnEverySurface`.

Everything below and above describes the numbers themselves — the floor decides
whether they reach a surface, never what they are.

## Assumptions and limitations

- Luteal phase defaults to a constant 14 days and is only refined when enough
  logged BBT / cervical-mucus signal exists; in reality it varies between people
  and cycles.
- Forward-looking predictions are **calendar-based** and cannot observe the
  body: the dates projected into the future do not use temperature, LH tests,
  or symptoms. Logged BBT / cervical-mucus signals only refine the luteal
  phase and confirm past ovulation retrospectively (see the "3-over-6" rule
  above), never predict a future one.
- Accuracy degrades sharply for irregular or very short/long cycles.
- The model is **not** a fertility-awareness contraceptive method (which require
  trained tracking of multiple biomarkers).
- **A newly logged period can move the predicted next-period date slightly
  earlier.** The projection is `last period start + predicted cycle length`, and
  logging a new start advances *both* terms: the anchor moves forward, and the new
  observed cycle re-estimates the length. When the fresh cycle is much shorter
  than the running estimate, the shrinking estimate outweighs the advancing
  anchor. Two starts on 1990-01-01 and 1990-02-17 give a single observed cycle of
  47 days, so the prediction is 1990-04-05. Logging a third start on 1990-03-04
  adds a 15-day cycle; the median of `[15, 47]` is 31, so the prediction becomes
  1990-03-04 + 31 = 1990-04-04 — one day earlier than before. This is the
  intended behaviour of an estimator revising on new evidence, not a regression:
  the model deliberately re-estimates cycle length instead of holding it fixed.

- **Which thresholds are clinical and which are engineering heuristics.** Only
  one threshold is taken from a clinical classification: the 24-day boundary
  behind the short-cycle note on the stats page (FIGO AUB System 1: a cycle
  shorter than 24 days is *frequent*, one longer than 38 days *infrequent*; see
  below). The onboarding hint's "about 24-38 days" quotes the same range. The
  following are engineering heuristics, chosen for display safety and not
  clinical boundaries: the 10–20 day window the luteal inference filters its
  samples through, the seven days past the reference length after which a
  cycle counts as overdue and projections pause, the seven-day spread between
  cycle lengths past which predictions are treated as irregular, and the
  minimum of three cycles before a pattern note (short, long or irregular)
  appears.

## Physiological basis

The ~14-day luteal phase and the "6-day fertile window ending at ovulation" are
standard reproductive-physiology concepts (e.g. the fertile-window work of
Wilcox et al., *NEJM* 1995). ovumcy applies them as a transparent calendar
estimate, nothing more. An estimated window often misses the real fertile
days, regular cycles included: in a prospective study only about 30% of women
had their fertile window entirely within the days clinical guidelines name
(Wilcox AJ, Dunson D, Baird DD, *BMJ* 2000, PMID 11082086). That is why a day
outside the window is reported as `outside_estimated_window`, never as a day on
which conception is not possible, and why the irregular range mode widens the
current cycle's window rather than narrowing the doubt to one median estimate.

The 24-day short-cycle boundary follows the FIGO AUB System 1 normal range for
cycle frequency, 24–38 days (Munro MG et al., *Int J Gynecol Obstet*
2018;143:393–408).

## Verifying this document

Every numeric claim above is enforced by `TestCyclePrediction_GoldenVectors`
and related tests in `internal/services/cycles_reference_test.go`. Property-based
tests (`cycles_property_test.go`) additionally assert the invariants for
thousands of generated inputs.

### Golden-vector fixture (shared with ovumcy-app in origin, not yet in lockstep)

The worked examples above are pinned to the code by a **golden-vector
fixture**, [`internal/services/testdata/cycle-prediction-golden-vectors.json`](../internal/services/testdata/cycle-prediction-golden-vectors.json),
consumed by `TestCyclePrediction_GoldenVectors`. The fixture originated with
ovumcy-app's `src/services/__fixtures__/cycle-prediction-golden-vectors.json`
(ovumcy-app PR #75), where it is consumed by
`src/services/cycle-prediction-reference.test.ts`. The two copies are **not**
currently byte-identical and nothing enforces that they match, so lockstep with
the app is not established.

The Go source of truth here (`internal/services/cycles.go`) and ovumcy-app's
TypeScript port (`src/services/cycle-prediction-policy.ts`) are hand-parallel
implementations; only once the two fixture copies are brought back in sync
would a divergence between them fail CI on both sides. If you change the
prediction math, update the fixture, both docs (this file and ovumcy-app's
`docs/cycle-prediction.md`), and both reference tests in the same change.

#### Projection / anchor section

The `vectors` section above pins the pure window math (`PredictCycleWindow`:
period start + cycle length + luteal phase → ovulation and fertile window). It
does **not** cover the layer production wraps around that math to project a live
prediction for a given day: choosing the cycle length from history, anchoring the
current cycle, and rolling ovulation forward. That layer is pinned by a second,
**additive** top-level key in the same fixture file, `projection`, consumed by
`TestCycleProjection_GoldenVectors`. Each projection vector takes a cycle-length
history plus `lastPeriodStart`, `today`, and an IANA `timezone`, and locks four
stages:

1. **Prediction length** — median-first (`predictedCycleLength`): the median of
   the recent-cycle window, falling back to the rounded mean only when no median
   exists. The `[28, 28, 28, 28, 60]` vector nails this down: it must select the
   median (28), never the mean (~34) that a single merged-log outlier inflates.
2. **Projected cycle start + cycle day** — `ProjectCycleStart` advances the last
   period start by whole cycles up to `today` and reports the 1-based day within
   the current cycle.
3. **Displayed next-period date** — the last recorded period start plus the
   selected length, re-anchored in the request timezone: the period that closes
   the running cycle. It is never rolled a cycle forward with the stage-2 start —
   from cycle day m+1 that period is late and due now, not a cycle away, and the
   overdue gate withholds it once it is more than a week behind.
4. **Ovulation date** — the window for the projected cycle, rolled forward once
   by `ShiftCycleStartToFutureOvulation` when its ovulation already fell before
   `today`, so a displayed ovulation is never in the past.

All of this is calendar-day arithmetic and therefore **DST-immune**: the
`Europe/Berlin` 2026-03-29 spring-forward vector must project identically to a
UTC run — a truncating hour-based day count would mis-roll the cycle across the
23-hour transition day. The key is additive so an older twin that reads only
`vectors` keeps passing against a byte-identical file until it grows a
`projection` consumer of its own.
