### Fixed

- **`docs/openapi.yaml` mischaracterized `ForgotPasswordRequest.recovery_code`.** The schema's
  pattern required the full `OVUM-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` shape even though `ForgotPassword` treats an
  absent or blank `recovery_code` — empty, or all whitespace, matching the server's own
  `strings.TrimSpace(...) == ""` test — as the step-1 request and answers it successfully — never as
  a refusal. A client that validates its step-1 body (`email` only, `recovery_code: " "`) against
  the published spec before sending it would have the request rejected by its own tooling even
  though the server accepts it. The pattern now has a `|^\s*$` alternative for that value, and both
  the field's own description and the schema's top-level description now say plainly that
  `recovery_code`'s absent/blank case selects step 1 rather than being refused — unlike `password`,
  whose absent/blank case in step 2 is refused by name.
