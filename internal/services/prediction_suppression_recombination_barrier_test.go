// Barrier for the recombined-suppression class.
//
// Every medical-safety suppression signal lives in ONE predicate here —
// PredictionsSuppressed for the whole projection, FertilityProjectionSuppressed
// for the fertility half — and a surface either calls that predicate or reads
// the decision the cycle context already resolved. What it may not do is spell
// the disjuncts out again for itself. That is not a style preference: the three
// signals WERE written out once per surface, so the fourth had to be found at
// four sites and the one that was missed stayed missing silently, which is the
// estimate-presented-as-fact the medical-safety invariant forbids
// (docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md -> medical safety).
//
// The prose ban is not new and it is not enough: it was breached three times
// running and caught by review each time, which is a control that works only
// while somebody is looking. This sweep looks.
//
// WHAT IT FLAGS. One boolean expression, outside the file that declares the
// predicates, whose operands name TWO OR MORE distinct suppression signals. Two
// signals in one condition is a hand-built gate; one signal beside an ordinary
// operand (a count, a date, a settings flag) is a surface asking its own
// question and stays legal — flagging those would red every honest call site
// and the barrier would be deleted within a week.
//
// WHAT IT CANNOT SEE, stated here and repeated in the failure text: a
// recombination assembled through intermediate variables — `disabled := …` on
// one line and `disabled || awaiting` on the next — reads as one signal per
// expression and passes. So does one built in a template: the owner templates
// receive PredictionDisabled and no second signal, so today a template CANNOT
// spell a second disjunct, and the day one is handed over is the day this sweep
// stops covering the surface that reads it.
