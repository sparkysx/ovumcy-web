- **The per-operation status guard now judges redirects instead of excluding them.**
  `TestOpenAPIOperationsDeclareEveryStatusTheirOwnHandlerChainCanEmit` listed `303` as
  cross-cutting, on the argument that any handler may reach the shared content-negotiation helper
  regardless of its own logic. That is true of the helper and false of a handler that falls through
  to `c.Redirect()` with nothing answering the JSON caller first — which is how both 2FA mutations
  redirected an `Accept: application/json` client to a page, undeclared, on a green `main`. The
  exclusion is gone and the surface question is answered where it is asked: the walk now reads an
  `if acceptsJSON(c) { … return … }` as ending the JSON caller's request, so later statements in
  that block are the HTML surface, and reads `switch responseFormat(c)` the same way, walking only
  its JSON arm. Measured on `10d4b7c8`, before either fix: dropping the exclusion alone reddened 20
  operations, of which the two 2FA ones were the only real findings; with both narrowings, none.
  - Two things stop the quieter guard from being a blind one. A new test,
    `TestStatusReachTellsARedirectJSONCallersGetFromOneTheyDoNot`, runs the analyser over source
    written for it — a bare fall-through, an `acceptsJSON` early return, the shared switch written
    both qualified and not, that switch with an initializer, and an `acceptsJSON` arm that does
    *not* return — and each case also asserts a status the walk must still find, so a run that
    reached nothing cannot pass as a run that found nothing. The switch narrowing matches its JSON
    arm by the constant's NAME rather than one spelling of it, and walks the initializer, because
    it is the one narrowing here whose misses hide a JSON status instead of an HTML one. The sweep
    itself now fails when it judged fewer `/api/v1` operations than `docs/openapi.yaml` declares —
    a floor read out of the spec rather than written beside it, because a route table that failed
    to load and a clean tree print the same nothing.
