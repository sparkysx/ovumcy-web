// recorded temperatures, periodLength is still a projection of the average,
// and when an observation lands inside or before the projected period the
// observation narrows periodLength instead — the projection has no standing
// to hide a ribbon an observation can place. Only ovulationDay > cycleLength
// stays a refusal on both branches: that is a day past the ribbon's own axis,
// which no clamp on periodLength can fix.
