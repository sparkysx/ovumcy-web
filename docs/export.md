# Data Export Format

Ovumcy supports three export endpoints under `Settings → Export`:

- `GET /api/v1/exports/json` — full per-day records as JSON.
- `GET /api/v1/exports/csv` — full per-day records as CSV.
- `GET /api/v1/exports/summary` — small JSON summary used by the Settings UI.

All three accept an optional date range via query parameters `from` and `to` (`YYYY-MM-DD`, in the user's timezone). Omitting them exports everything.

Each export endpoint requires the `owner` role and a valid auth session. CSRF is not required — these are GET reads and the auth cookie alone is sufficient.

## JSON Export

```http
GET /api/v1/exports/json?from=2026-01-01&to=2026-05-31
Cookie: ovumcy_auth=...
```

Response headers: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=ovumcy-export-<timestamp>.json`, `Content-Type: application/json`. The filename is unquoted, as the server emits it.

Response body:

```json
{
  "exported_at": "2026-05-17T14:32:01+03:00",
  "entries": [
    {
      "date": "2026-05-17",
      "period": true,
      "cycle_start": false,
      "is_uncertain": false,
      "flow": "medium",
      "mood_rating": 3,
      "sex_activity": "protected",
      "bbt": 36.7,
      "cervical_mucus": "creamy",
      "pregnancy_test": "negative",
      "cycle_factors": ["stress", "travel"],
      "symptoms": {
        "cramps": true,
        "headache": false,
        "acne": false,
        "mood": false,
        "bloating": true,
        "fatigue": true,
        "breast_tenderness": false,
        "back_pain": false,
        "nausea": false,
        "spotting": false,
        "irritability": false,
        "insomnia": false,
        "food_cravings": false,
        "diarrhea": false,
        "constipation": false,
        "swelling": false
      },
      "other_symptoms": ["my-custom-symptom"],
      "notes": "felt tired all afternoon"
    }
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `exported_at` | RFC 3339 string | Server time at export, in the user's timezone. |
| `entries` | array | One entry per logged day. Days with no data are not exported. |
| `last_period_start` | `YYYY-MM-DD` string, optional | The owner's onboarding start, a cycle boundary no logged day carries. Present only when the account has one and the requested range includes it. Restore sets it only on an account that holds none. |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` string | Calendar day in the user's timezone. |
| `period` | boolean | Whether the day is marked as a period day. |
| `flow` | string | One of `none`, `spotting`, `light`, `medium`, `heavy`. |
| `mood_rating` | integer | User-selected mood scale. Zero means unset. |
| `sex_activity` | string | One of `none`, `protected`, `unprotected`. |
| `bbt` | float | Basal body temperature in Celsius, always — storage is canonical Celsius regardless of the account's display unit, and export emits the stored value unconverted. Emitted only when measured; the key is absent on unmeasured days. On import, an absent key, an explicit `null`, or a legacy `0` are all read as "not measured"; a value outside the accepted range is read as "not measured" too, like any other malformed field, rather than rejecting the day. |
| `cervical_mucus` | string | One of `none`, `dry`, `moist`, `creamy`, `eggwhite`. |
| `pregnancy_test` | string | One of `none`, `negative`, `positive`. |
| `cycle_factors` | array of strings | Factor keys recorded that day, from the closed catalog `stress`, `illness`, `travel`, `sleep_disruption`, `medication_change`. Any other key is dropped on import. |
| `symptoms` | object of booleans | Flags for the 16 built-in symptoms. Always present, even when all false. |
| `other_symptoms` | array of strings | Names of owner-managed custom symptoms recorded that day. |
| `notes` | string | Free-text note. |
| `cycle_start` | boolean | Whether the day is the manually marked start of a cycle. Owner-only. |
| `is_uncertain` | boolean | Whether the owner flagged this day's data as uncertain. Owner-only. |

The `symptoms` object always contains the same 16 keys, in this order: `cramps`, `headache`, `acne`, `mood`, `bloating`, `fatigue`, `breast_tenderness`, `back_pain`, `nausea`, `spotting`, `irritability`, `insomnia`, `food_cravings`, `diarrhea`, `constipation`, `swelling`. Any other symptom configured by the owner appears in `other_symptoms` as a free-text name.

## CSV Export

```http
GET /api/v1/exports/csv?from=2026-01-01&to=2026-05-31
Cookie: ovumcy_auth=...
```

Response headers: `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=ovumcy-export-<timestamp>.csv`, `Content-Type: text/csv`. The filename is unquoted, as the server emits it.

Columns (in order, single header row):

```
Date, Period, Flow, Mood rating, Sex activity, BBT (C), Cervical mucus,
Cramps, Headache, Acne, Mood, Bloating, Fatigue, Breast tenderness,
Back pain, Nausea, Spotting, Irritability, Insomnia, Food cravings,
Diarrhea, Constipation, Swelling, Cycle factors, Other, Notes, Pregnancy test,
Cycle start, Uncertain
```

Cell semantics:

- `Date` is `YYYY-MM-DD` in the user's timezone.
- `Period`, and the 16 symptom columns, are `Yes`/`No`.
- `Swelling` was appended after `Constipation` (the last symptom column at the time) rather than at the very end of the file; every column at or after `Cycle factors` therefore shifted one position to the right for files generated after this change. Downstream consumers reading columns by position (not by header name) must account for the shift.
- `Flow`, `Sex activity`, `Cervical mucus`, `Pregnancy test` are human-readable, capitalized labels (e.g. `Spotting`, `Protected`, `Egg white`, `Negative`), not the same lowercase enum strings used by the JSON export.
- `BBT (C)` is always the stored value in Celsius; storage is canonical Celsius regardless of the account's display unit, and export emits it unconverted. The cell is empty on days with no measurement. The header keeps the literal text `BBT (C)` for stability even though it always holds Celsius.
- `Cycle factors` is a `; `-separated list of the same human-readable labels the app shows (`Stress`, `Illness`, `Travel`, `Sleep disruption`, `Medication change`) — not the lowercase keys the JSON export emits; empty when none were recorded.
- `Other` is a `; `-separated list of owner-managed custom symptom names; empty when none.
- `Notes` is the free-text note; the CSV writer quotes the cell as needed.
- CSV-injection mitigation: `Cycle factors`, `Other`, and `Notes` are the only cells built from user-entered text. If such a cell (after stripping leading spaces) starts with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, or a tab/CR/LF, a leading `'` is prepended so spreadsheet apps do not interpret it as a formula.
- `Pregnancy test` was introduced after the 1.1.1 layout and appended after the original columns so existing column positions stay stable, per the stability rule below.
- `Cycle start` and `Uncertain` are `Yes`/`No`. They are the last two columns, appended after `Pregnancy test` so existing column positions stay stable, per the stability rule below. `Cycle start` marks the manually flagged start of a cycle; `Uncertain` marks a day the owner flagged as uncertain. Both are owner-only.
- The owner's onboarding start (the JSON export's `last_period_start`, under the same range rule) is marked `Cycle start = Yes` on its row; when no day was logged on it, the file carries a bare row holding only the date and that mark.

## Summary Export

```http
GET /api/v1/exports/summary?from=2026-01-01&to=2026-05-31
Cookie: ovumcy_auth=...
```

Response is JSON (not a file download), used by the Settings UI before showing the full export buttons:

```json
{
  "total_entries": 142,
  "has_data": true,
  "date_from": "2025-09-01",
  "date_to": "2026-05-17"
}
```

All four keys are always present. `date_from`/`date_to` report the **extent of the data found**, not the requested range: they are the earliest and latest logged day inside it, so an unbounded query with logs still returns concrete dates. They are empty strings exactly when the range holds no entries at all (alongside `has_data: false` and `total_entries: 0`).

## Import (restore)

`POST /api/v1/imports/json` restores a prior JSON export back into the current account. It is the inverse of `GET /api/v1/exports/json` and consumes the exact `{ "exported_at": ..., "entries": [...] }` shape documented above (`exported_at` is ignored on import).

Request: `Content-Type: application/json`, body = the raw export file. Requires the `owner` role, a valid auth session, and a CSRF token (`X-CSRF-Token` header or `csrf_token` form field) — it is state-mutating, unlike the GET exports.

The restore is **additive**: each entry creates its day only if the account does not already have that calendar day. Existing days are never overwritten or deleted, so no re-authentication is required at all (contrast clear-data / delete-account, which always cost one), and re-importing the same file is safe and idempotent.

Every field is re-validated and sanitized server-side (the file is untrusted input): unknown enum values fall back to their neutral default, `notes` is length-capped, invalid cycle-factor keys are dropped, and `cycle_start`/`is_uncertain` are cleared on non-period days. Built-in symptom flags map back to the owner's own catalog; names in `other_symptoms` are matched to existing symptoms or created as custom symptoms. All writes are scoped to the session owner.

Response `200`:

```json
{ "ok": true, "added": 128, "skipped": 14, "rejected": 0 }
```

- `added` — days created.
- `skipped` — days that already existed and were left untouched.
- `rejected` — malformed or duplicate day records dropped without writing.

### Size limits

Two independent caps bound a restore, and they surface as **two different 413 keys** — a client keying on the error string needs both:

| Cap | Value | Error |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Request body | **16 MiB** | `413 request_too_large`, enforced at the transport layer before the handler runs — the import service never sees the bytes. Applies to the body as the server reads it, decompressed size included; see below. |
| Entries per file | **20 000** | `413 import file too large`. Enforced by the import service on the parsed payload. |

The body limit is sized to the entry cap (20 000 day records serialize to roughly 8–12 MiB), so a file at the documented entry ceiling stays comfortably under it. A file that trips the body limit is therefore either far past the entry cap or carrying unusually large `notes`.

**Compressed requests (`Content-Encoding: gzip`/`deflate`/`br`/`zstd`) are bounded by the same 16 MiB, applied twice.** The raw bytes on the wire are capped regardless of encoding, so a compressed body that is itself over 16 MiB is refused while the request is read. A well-compressed body can stay under that on the wire and still expand past 16 MiB, so the cap is applied a second time to the **decompressed** stream, and a body that crosses it is refused there too. Either way the answer is the same `413 request_too_large` and the restore never starts: the import service is never handed a partial or substituted payload, so an oversized upload is never reported as a malformed file. Uncompressed requests only ever meet the first check — their wire size and parsed size are the same number.

Error responses use stable, PII-free keys: `400 invalid import file` (not valid JSON), the two 413s above, and `500 failed to import data`.

Importing from other trackers (e.g. Drip) is out of scope for this endpoint — see [issue #116](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/issues/116).

## Stability

The JSON entry shape and CSV columns are stable across Ovumcy patch and minor releases. Breaking changes (renaming or removing a field, changing the value vocabulary, reordering CSV columns) ship in a major release with a migration note in `CHANGELOG.md`. Adding a new field to the JSON entry or a new column at the end of the CSV is non-breaking and does not trigger a major bump.

The wrapping JSON shape (`exported_at` / `entries`) follows the same rule.
