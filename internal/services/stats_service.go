// BuildCycleStatsFromLogs computes cycle stats from already-fetched logs, for

//
// It is package-level because it consults NO repositories: the whole derivation
// is BuildCycleStats + ApplyUserCycleBaseline + ResolvePregnancyPause over the
// logs it is handed. The repository-free callers — the webhook decision pass and
// the .ics feed — used to say that in a comment and reach it through
// NewStatsService(nil, nil), a service whose two fields exist only to be not
// dereferenced. Here the property is structural: there is no receiver to hold a
// nil store, so a future line that needs one cannot compile into this function
// unnoticed.
//
// The three passes run over ONE timeline, bounded at the owner's today. Only
// BuildCycleStats bounded its own input (cycles.go, filterLogsNotAfter); the
// baseline and the pregnancy pause were handed the raw set, so a day logged
// ahead of today reached two of the three. ResolvePregnancyPause is where that
// cost something: it lifts a pause on ANY cycle boundary later than the
// positive test, and an explicit mark opens one whatever its date, while
// manualCycleStartFutureDays lets an
// owner record a start two days ahead. The surfaces that looked safe were safe
// by accident — the dashboard and the .ics feed pre-bound the set they pass
// (FilterLogsByDateRange, the fetched range), and the webhook notify pass, the
// one surface that speaks to a destination outside the instance, passed the
// whole stored history. So a positive test today plus a permitted start
// tomorrow left the owner paused everywhere they could look and unpaused in the
// payload leaving the instance. Bounding here rather than at each caller is what
// makes "one timeline" a property of the derivation instead of a habit of three
// call sites: suppression is the floor, and a floor one surface stands a day in
// front of is not one.
