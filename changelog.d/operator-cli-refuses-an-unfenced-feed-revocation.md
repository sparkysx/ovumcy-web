### Security

- **`ovumcy users delete` and `ovumcy reset-password` now refuse a calendar-feed revocation they
  cannot record outside the database, instead of completing it anyway.** The restore fence — a
  marker kept in two places, one inside the database and one in a file at
  `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH` — advances on every write that arms, rotates or removes a feed, but
  the operator CLI's own writes only ever advanced the database half: an operator's shell rarely
  shares the server's `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH`, so the file half stayed behind. A restore of the
  backup taken just before such a revocation then agreed with that unmoved file, and the feed the
  operator believed gone served the calendar again — the exact defect the fence exists to close,
  reintroduced through the one write path that never confirmed it. A second, narrower window let
  the same gap mask a genuine restore: an operator running the CLI with a *working* anchor, after a
  restore had landed but before the server had booted against it, minted a token that
  resynchronized the two halves, so the boot that followed read an ordinary restart instead of the
  restore that had just happened.

  Both commands now confirm the two halves already agree before advancing them, and refuse — the
  account or the password left exactly as it was — when they do not: no path configured, an
  unmounted volume, a file and marker that disagree, or a fence neither half has ever recorded.
  Every refusal but one leaves both halves untouched; the exception is a database write that fails
  right after the file half has already moved, which is named plainly instead of folded into the
  same wording, and points at a server restart rather than a bare rerun. The refusal otherwise
  names `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH`, what continuing anyway would have cost, and what to run
  instead. Run either command through `docker compose exec` on the running container, or against
  the same fence path the server uses — the server's own file, never a copy of it — to reach it.
  Full contract: `docs/self-hosted.md → Calendar Feed Restore Fence`.

  The price is deliberate, and it falls on one recovery path. `reset-password` is the documented last
  way back into an account whose second factor died with a rotated or lost `SECRET_KEY`, and on a
  server that has never started with `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH` configured it is now refused as well:
  configure the fence for the server, start it once, then run the reset. The bundled compose stacks
  mount the fence already, so `docker compose exec` there needs nothing extra. There is no flag to
  skip the check — a reset that revokes a feed nowhere a restore could contradict is the defect, not
  an inconvenience.
