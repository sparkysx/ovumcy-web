	// and the personalised one when their luteal phase has been inferred). Two of
	// its tiers matter here
	// beyond the early returns above. Until the first cycle closes there are no
	// observed cycle lengths, so the window is the default length projected
	// forward with the default luteal phase: where the only source is
	// configuration defaults, suppression is the floor and a qualifier is not
	// enough (docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md -> medical safety). And once the cycle
	// has run more than a week past its own length (DashboardCycleOverdue), the
	// window is a projection the account's data no longer supports: three 28-day
	// cycles beside one 300-day gap still placed it on days 9-14 of a cycle on
	// day 61, and saving one of those days called it fertile while every other
	// surface withheld the window. The save falls back to the neutral message
	// rather than softening the fertile one.

	// The line speaks about the day being saved only when that day is today. A day
	// already behind the owner is a backfill, recorded after the fact, and the
	// line would read as a claim about a day that is over; a day still ahead is
	// not what the owner is living in yet, so it gets no claim either.
	//
	// Out-of-date data is a third tier, and the one PublishedStats does not answer
	// with a cleared window: it withholds the status and the phase and leaves the
	// projected dates beside the out-of-date banner. This message reads the window,
	// so it asks the same verdict (CycleDataStale on the published copy): a toast
	// naming a window the cycle has already outrun would say what both owner
	// pages, which print "unknown" there, do not.
