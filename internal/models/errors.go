import "errors"

// Sentinels that more than one layer has to name.
//
// internal/services deliberately does not import internal/db: the business
// layer would then carry the driver and the migration set in its build graph.
// A fact both layers speak about therefore has nowhere to live inside either of
// them, and declaring it in both produces two errors.New values with identical
// text — never errors.Is-equal, so a comparison across the boundary is false
// for an error whose message is character-for-character the one being tested
// for, while reading as a working check.
//
// internal/models is the one package both already import, and it costs nothing
// to reach: it is transport-free, and neither layer's dependency set grows by a
// single package. Each layer re-exports the value under its own name, so both
// spellings are the same error.
//
// A sentinel belongs here only when both layers need it. One that a single
// layer raises and only its own callers inspect stays in that layer.
// Regression: TestNoErrorSentinelTextIsDeclaredInMoreThanOneLayer.

	// password sign-in available. The service answers it from its own read for
	// the common case; the identity repository raises it again from inside the
	// delete transaction, after locking the account row, so two concurrent
	// unlinks cannot each count the other's identity and remove both.

	// and this write rolled back rather than hand its caller a session that
	// outlives that revocation.
