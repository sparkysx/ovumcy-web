// These tests guard against the account-existence timing oracle: every
// "invalid creds" early-return path in AuthenticateCredentials must still
// invoke the bcrypt equalizer so an attacker cannot distinguish
// "no such email" (~1ms early return) from "wrong password for existing
// user" (~50ms+).
//
// The earlier wall-clock budget (`elapsed >= 15*time.Millisecond`) was
// replaced with a call-counter wrapper to remove wall-clock fragility on
// shared CI runners. The counter asserts the equalizer was invoked exactly
// once per call; that is half the invariant.
//
// The other half is that the equalizer still SPENDS something, and neither the
// counter nor TestCredentialsTimingEqualizationHashIsBcryptCompatible can see
// it: the counter replaces the whole var, and the hash check reads the constant
// without ever asking whether the body still compares against it. An emptied
// body left both of them green while the unknown-address branch returned with
// no bcrypt work at all. TestAuthCredentialsEqualizerBodyComparesThePlaceholder
// below closes that by swapping the compare INSIDE the body — the same seam
// discipline timingTopUpCompare already gives the top-up half.
