//
// The calendar's solid marker and the stats chart both moved onto the
// detector's own date; the dashboard line did not. It is fed by
// DashboardUpcomingPredictions, which rolls its anchor to the NEXT cycle only
// when CalendarDaysBetween(window.OvulationDate, today) > 0 — so on the very day
// the projection fell on, the difference is zero, the anchor stays, and the line
// announces an ovulation the recorded temperatures place several days earlier.

//
// Both surfaces now resolve the day through ConfirmedCurrentCycleOvulation. The
// substitution changes only WHICH day is named: whether a day may be named at
// all stays with the suppression gates.
