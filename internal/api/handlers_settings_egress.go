// Egress ledger — the owner-only section's mutation transport.
//
// One endpoint is new here: DELETE /api/v1/users/current/webhook, which
// withdraws the stored destination. It exists because the only previous way to
// remove one was to submit the whole settings form with a "remove" checkbox
// ticked, which meant an owner could not withdraw an endpoint this instance can
// no longer decrypt — the form's save path validates and re-encrypts a URL, and
// the row it needed to act on is exactly the one that cannot be read.
//
// The write behind it touches the endpoint columns and nothing else. Routing it
// through the shared save would have written reminder_lead_days as well, and a
// zero lead window makes a reminder due on exactly one calendar day with no
// later pass to retry it: a "remove my webhook" click would silently cost the
// owner their next banner reminder too.
//
// Nothing on this path decrypts webhook_url. That is what keeps the unreadable
// state actionable rather than a trap.
