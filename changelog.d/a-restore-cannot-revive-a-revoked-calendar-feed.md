### Security

- **Restoring a backup no longer brings a revoked calendar feed back to life.** Revoking or
  rotating an `.ics` subscription cleared the feed columns and nothing else, so restoring a backup
  taken before that revocation returned them exactly as they were: the old subscribe URL served the
  owner's calendar again, under the same application secret, with nothing in the restored data
  recording that a revocation had ever happened. The behaviour was documented as a step the
  operator had to remember after every restore — re-check each owner's feed and revoke it again —
  and only the account itself can see or change its own feed, so an owner nobody told kept a live
  subscription they believed was gone.

  Ovumcy now settles it without the operator in the loop. A **restore fence** keeps a marker in two
  places, one inside the database and one in a file outside it, and advances both together on every
  change to the set of armed feeds. A restore rolls back only the copy inside the database, the two
  disagree, and the instance disarms every armed calendar feed on the boot that follows — before it
  accepts a request, so no poll can race it. Owners re-generate their subscribe URL from
  `Settings → Calendar feed`. This works on SQLite and on PostgreSQL alike, and does not depend on
  the application secret changing: the existing key-epoch sentinel covers a rotated `SECRET_KEY`
  and structurally could not cover this, because the epoch it compares is restored together with
  the feed columns it is meant to judge.

  **Operators: this needs one change to your deployment.** The fence file has to live somewhere your
  database backups do not capture, which is the whole mechanism. The bundled compose stacks now
  mount a separate `ovumcy_fence` volume for it, and the image points `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH`
  there by default. Take that volume from the updated compose file for your stack. Never include it
  in a backup and never restore it beside the database — a fence restored together with the
  database agrees with it and detects nothing. Losing it is cheap by design: it holds no health data
  and no secrets, and the cost is one round of re-generated subscribe URLs.

  **Run the operator CLI where the server's fence is visible.** `ovumcy reset-password` and
  `ovumcy users delete` both remove calendar-feed access, and now confirm and advance the same
  fence before that removal is allowed to happen — never merely warn about it. Through
  `docker compose exec` on the running container they already see it; from a host shell that
  does not, they refuse instead of completing, naming the variable and what to run instead, and
  change nothing.

  An instance with nowhere to keep the fence — the image pulled without the new volume, or the
  binary run outside compose with the variable unset — starts normally and keeps serving, but
  disarms every armed calendar feed on each start and says so in its startup log, naming the
  variable to set. Without a fence a restored backup cannot be told apart from the database it
  replaced, so the feed fails closed rather than quietly returning to the old behaviour. The two
  operator subcommands above are the exception to "keeps working": with no fence to advance,
  `reset-password` and `users delete` refuse rather than erase without a record, so an instance
  that has never started with `CALENDAR_FEED_FENCE_PATH` configured has to be started once with
  it before either can run. Full contract: `docs/self-hosted.md → Calendar Feed Restore Fence`.
