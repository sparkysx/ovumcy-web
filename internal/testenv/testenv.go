// Package testenv gives every test package one shared answer to the same
// question: a test that cannot find a resource it needs — a binary on PATH,
// the tz database — is answering "is it absent" and "did it misbehave once
// found" with the SAME t.Skipf, and only the first of those two may ever
// legitimately skip.
//
// An absence is a legitimate skip on a developer machine, and a failure on a
// lane that declared the resource mandatory (SkipUnlessRequired). An
// operational error — the resource was found but answered wrong, or a
// daemon behind it did not respond — is always a failure, on every machine,
// because a check that "ran" without actually exercising what it claims
// proves nothing either way (Fail). Conflating the two into one t.Skipf is
// exactly what lets a required check disappear under a misconfigured runner:
// the runner reports a broken tool the same way a developer machine reports
// one it never installed.
//
// Adapted from two mechanisms already in this tree: internal/testdb's
// OVUMCY_REQUIRE_POSTGRES gate (the fail-closed env-var reading, and the rule
// that only the docker-absent preflight may skip while every later docker
// error fails), and scripts/publishorder's requireShellTool (verifying a
// shell binary by running it through the same shell that will use it, not by
// exec.LookPath alone — the check has to say the right thing, not merely
// answer at all).
