# Mutation testing wrapper around gremlins (https://github.com/go-gremlins/gremlins).
#
# Why this exists: high test coverage does not prove tests actually catch broken
# code. Mutation testing injects faults into the production code and checks that
# at least one test fails ("kills" the mutant). Surviving mutants mark assertions
# that are too weak. Efficacy = killed / (killed + lived).
#
# Modes:
#   baseline        Full run over the high-value packages. Slow (hours). Run
#                   locally or by the weekly CI job; writes per-package JSON under
#                   .tmp/mutation/ and a committed score summary under .mutation/.
#   diff [ref]      Mutate only code changed vs <ref> (default origin/main).
#                   Fast enough for CI. Advisory: never fails the build.
#   verify-shards   Proves every registered shard partition is exact — for each
#                   entry in SHARDED_PKGS, every non-test .go file lands in
#                   exactly one shard, no gaps, no overlaps. No gremlins/network
#                   dependency — pure file-listing arithmetic, safe to run in any
#                   CI job or locally.
#   merge-shards <base> [in-dir] [out-file]
#                   Combines a registered package's <base>_1..N shard JSON
#                   reports (once downloaded from their CI artifacts) into one
#                   <base>.json, via scripts/mutationmerge (go run).
#
# The test-suite auditor consumes the JSON output
# to triage survivors into "real test gap" vs "equivalent mutant".
#
# Mutation testing is scoped to business-logic + security + transport packages.
# internal/services is the largest of them (11.5k source lines against
# internal/api's 8.1k), but internal/api is the slowest: it carries heavy
# integration tests against a real database, and each mutant re-runs them. Both
# are sharded for that reason — budget accordingly (see MUTATION_WORKERS below
# and the weekly CI job).
#
# Sharding (issue #161): a single unsharded internal_api run blew
# past the 3h CI timeout (manual run 28741574692: killed at 3h0m16s, having
# reached only ~85% of the package's files with a steady, non-decelerating
# mutant rate — internal/services, at least as large a target, finished its
# *whole* run in 1h53m, so internal/api's heavier DB-integration tests are the
# bottleneck, not raw file count). gremlins has no package-subdivision or
# --include-files flag, but `unleash` does support repeatable --exclude-files
# <regexp> (matched against each candidate file's basename within the target
# package). That is the only file-subset mechanism the installed gremlins
# v0.6.0 exposes, so sharding partitions a registered package's own non-test .go
# files into the shard count SHARDED_PKGS declares for it and, for shard N,
# excludes every file that is NOT in group N. The partition is computed at run
# time from a live directory listing (never a hardcoded file list) so it
# self-heals as files are added/removed — see shard_files below. Files are
# dealt by WEIGHT, not by count (scripts/mutationpartition): each is weighed by
# the operators gremlins' default mutators rewrite and dealt heaviest first to
# the lightest shard. Round-robin by file count, the earlier rule, left the
# five internal/services shards holding 462..868 candidates (tree of
# 2026-09-25), so the heaviest cells hit the 3h cap while others idled.

# internal/api and internal/services are each sharded (see header comment):
# both outgrew the 3h CI timeout as a single unsharded job (internal/api first,
# issue #161; internal/services once its integration/property suites expanded).
# Shard counts come from the weekly runs of 2026-08-31..09-21, where 5 shards
# each left every internal/api cell at the 180-minute cap with 52-96% of its
# files reached. Measured on those logs, one mutation candidate costs about
# 1.24 wall-minutes in internal/api and 0.41 in internal/services at 2 workers,
# plus gremlins' coverage run (up to ~9 and ~2 minutes). The 0.41 estimate
# undershot: run 36138463409 (2026-09-25, 10 internal/services shards
# near-equal at ~290 weight each) actually took 101-172 wall-minutes on the 8
# that finished (rate up to 0.594/weight, not 0.41); the other 2
# (internal_services_6, _7 — no single file heavier than 97 of either shard's
# ~289) hit the 180-minute cap still running, which only lower-bounds their
# rate — >= 180/289 ≈ 0.623/weight, with no upper bound, since the cap cut
# them off before one showed. 14 shards brings internal/services to ~207
# weight each: at that lower bound the slow cells land near ~129 minutes, and
# the 180-minute cap tolerates up to ~0.87/weight (180/207) — about 1.4x the
# lower bound — before a cell hits it again. The next dispatched run is the
# confirmation either way.
#
# internal/api's own 14-shard split (weight ~94-95 each, near-perfectly even —
# see scripts/mutationpartition) still wasn't enough: run 36274821938
# (2026-09-27, WEB-88, following WEB-78's baseline) cancelled internal_api_12
# and _13 at the 180-minute cap while still running (jobs
# 108495416352/108495416342), which only lower-bounds their rate at
# >= 180/94 ≈ 1.915/weight, no upper bound — higher than every one of the
# other 12 internal_api shards that finished on the same run at the same
# ~94-95 weight each (0.52-1.63/weight), the same "a completed shard's rate
# understates the one that hit the cap" pattern internal_services showed on
# 2026-09-25. 20 shards brings internal/api to ~66-67 weight each: the cap
# then tolerates up to ~2.7/weight (180/67) — about 1.4x that lower bound,
# the same margin ratio internal_services' 10->14 split used. The next
# dispatched run is the confirmation either way.
#
# 20 was not enough either: runs 36351058682 and 36413106904 (2026-09-27/28)
# both cancelled internal_api_20 at the cap, and _18 took 151 minutes, at an
# identical ~65-66 weight per shard. Wall time per shard ranged 28..>180 minutes
# on that even weight (0.4..>2.77 min/weight), so the token-count weight ranks
# files badly: it ignores which tests cover a file, and a handler that only the
# DB-backed step-up/OIDC suites reach costs several times a helper the fast
# tests kill. Per-shard wall times cannot give a per-file rate, so 30 shards
# were the first answer: ~43-44 weight each, the slowest observed rate
# (>=2.77/weight) near 122 minutes plus the whole-package coverage pass (up to
# ~9), a ~1.4x margin to the cap. Run 36942283202 then showed the weight itself
# is what misranks: gremlins stamps every mutant's verdict, so each file's cost
# is recoverable from the gaps between verdicts. scripts/mutationpartition
# scales each file's weight by that measured rate (its costs.json); on the
# measured files the heaviest internal/api shard falls from 145 to ~123 minutes
# and internal/services from past the cap to ~129. One file (stats_page_helpers.go,
# ~110 minutes alone) bounds how far any split can go. Re-measure after a run
# that cancels a cell. Keep this registry in sync
# with the matrix in .github/workflows/mutation.yml. Entries are
