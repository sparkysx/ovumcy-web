// Webhook reminder decision (issue #124, slice 2). This file is the PURE
// decision layer: given an owner, their webhook settings (including the two
// per-kind "already sent" watermarks passed in by the caller), their day logs,
// and an injected now/location, it reports which reminders are DUE right now.
//
// It performs NO delivery, NO outbound HTTP, and NO persistence — a later
// slice owns sending the POST and advancing the watermark. Keeping the decision
// pure makes every gate (window, suppression, idempotency, timezone) directly
// unit-testable with an injected clock.
//
// Medical-safety invariant: this function reuses the EXACT prediction path the
// dashboard uses (BuildCycleStatsFromLogs → DashboardUpcomingPredictions), gated
// by the verdict every surface shares (PublishedStats → PredictionsSuppressed /
// FertilityProjectionSuppressed) and shaped by the same range-or-date answer
// (ResolveProjectionRanges). It never sends a date the app itself refuses to
// show — when in-app predictions are suppressed it emits nothing, and where the
// dashboard shows a window it sends that window, not the median day.

const (
	// DueReminderTypePeriod and DueReminderTypeOvulation identify which upcoming
	// prediction a due reminder summarizes. They mirror the in-app banner kinds
	// (DashboardReminderBannerKind*) so downstream copy selection can stay
	// aligned with the dashboard.

// DueReminder is the transport-free result of the decision: one upcoming
// reminder that is within the owner's lead window and has not already been sent
// for its cycle. It carries no delivery concern (no URL, no payload) — that is
// the delivery slice's job.
//
//   - Type is DueReminderTypePeriod or DueReminderTypeOvulation.
//   - EventDate is the predicted event's owner-local calendar day (the next
//     period start, or the ovulation date) — or, where the dashboard shows a
//     range for it (ResolveProjectionRanges), the range's first day.
//   - EventDateEnd is the range's last day, and the zero time for a single
//     date.
//   - CycleAnchor is the cycle-start the event belongs to. It is the watermark
//     KEY: the delivery slice records it so at most one reminder of each kind is
//     sent per cycle, and this decision skips a reminder whose incoming
//     watermark already equals it.
//   - LeadDays echoes the window that was in force (settings.ReminderLeadDays,
//     clamped), for observability by the caller.
//
// EVERY EventDate here is an estimate, never fact (medical-safety invariant), so
// every surface rendering one must carry the estimate qualifier and the
// non-medical-advice disclaimer. That obligation used to be spelled as an
// Estimate field set to a literal true by both producers and read by nothing: a
// constant cannot distinguish a case, so no consumer could branch on it and the
// invariant travelled as prose wearing the shape of data. It travels as data
// where it is actually enforced — buildPayload sets WebhookPayload.Disclaimer on
// every payload unconditionally, and reminderCopy words the date as an estimate.
// Regression: TestNotifyDisclaimerPresentInEveryPayload.

// WebhookReminderSettings is the transport-free webhook decision input: the

//
// This mirrors the persisted columns on models.User / models.WebhookNotifyRecord
// but is a distinct decision-scoped type: the decision needs only these fields,
// not the whole account, and never the (still-ciphertext) webhook URL — the URL

// DecideDueReminders reports the webhook reminders that are due for an owner
// right now. It is pure: now and location are injected (never time.Now()), and
// it reads — never writes — the incoming watermarks.
//
// The decision, in order:
//
//   - Webhook delivery disabled ⇒ nothing.
//
//   - Build cycle stats from the owner's logs via the SAME path the dashboard
//     uses (BuildCycleStatsFromLogs, which needs no repositories).
//
//   - In-app predictions suppressed (PredictionsSuppressed: unpredictable-cycle
//     mode, a pregnancy pause, DashboardCycleOverdue — the running cycle is past
//     the account's own cycle length by more than a week — or irregular-cycle
//     mode with fewer than three completed cycles) ⇒ nothing. This is the
//     medical-safety gate: never emit a date the app itself refuses to show.
//
//     The overdue disjunct also keeps the period reminder's watermark KEY still
//     while the cycle stays unclosed: a next-period date rolled a whole cycle
//     forward is an anchor no watermark covers, and it re-armed a fresh "period
//     soon" send once per projected cycle. DashboardUpcomingPredictions keeps the
//     period on the running cycle, and this gate is what holds every other date
//     back once that period is more than a week late. Suppressing the
//     reminder suppresses the write too: this decision emits nothing, the notify
//     pass writes a watermark only after a 2xx delivery, so an overdue cycle
//     leaves the watermarks exactly where the last real send left them. When the
//     owner finally logs the real cycle start, the anchor is that new cycle's
//     projected next-period date — different from the stale watermark — so the
//     next legitimate reminder fires exactly once and its own watermark then
//     covers it.
//
//   - Resolve "today" as the owner-local calendar day (DateAtLocation) and the
//     median-first projection cycle length the dashboard feeds to its predictions
//     (DashboardProjectionCycleLength — the same statistic as stats.NextPeriodStart,
//     NOT the average-first staleness reference), then take the dashboard's own
//     upcoming prediction (DashboardUpcomingPredictions) for the authoritative
//     next-period and ovulation dates + flags.
//
//   - Shape each event the way the dashboard does (ResolveProjectionRanges):
//     where the page shows a start window or an ovulation range, the reminder
//     carries that range (EventDate..EventDateEnd), never the median day inside
//     it.
//
//   - period-soon: emitted when NotifyPeriod is on, the next period start is
//     known, and the event overlaps [today, today+leadDays] (inclusive) — for a
//     single date, not in the past and not beyond the window. Its cycle anchor
//     is the event's first day (the next period start itself, or the start
//     window's first day). Skipped when the incoming period watermark already
//     equals that anchor.
//
//   - ovulation-soon: emitted when NotifyOvulation is on and ovulation is
//     calculable (not impossible, non-zero), the fertility half is not withheld
//     (FertilityProjectionSuppressed: fewer than three completed cycles withholds
//     it for a regular owner as for an irregular one) and within the same window. Its cycle
//     anchor is the start of the cycle the ovulation belongs to (derived with the
//     same projection helpers the dashboard uses). Skipped when the incoming
//     ovulation watermark already equals that anchor.
//
// When both kinds are due, both are returned (unlike the single-slot in-app
// banner): a webhook consumer can act on each independently. Period precedes
// ovulation in the returned slice.
