// Package readmeversion guards README.md against release-tag drift: the
// current release tag is hardcoded in several places
// (intro blurb, Docker quick start image tag, cosign/attestation/SBOM
// verification examples, and the Releases section) with no single source of
// truth, so a release bump that updates one occurrence and misses another
// goes unnoticed. This test asserts every occurrence agrees.
//
// The same drift reaches the shipped example stacks: an `.env.example` under
// docs/examples/ that pins OVUMCY_IMAGE overrides its own compose file's
// default, and the runbook tells an operator to copy that template verbatim.
// So the release tag README.md asserts is also the tag every example env
// template must pin.
//
// It also reaches every compose file's own `${OVUMCY_IMAGE:-...}` fallback:
// an operator who never sets OVUMCY_IMAGE gets whatever tag is baked into
// that default, starting with the root docker-compose.yml the quick start
// tells a reader to run first.
