// Package releasegate holds the release tag gate to the one thing it exists to
// assert: that the six checks `:latest` waits for were really run on the
// commit being tagged.
//
// `verify-release-tag` in .github/workflows/docker-image.yml is the only gate
// on the release path — a tag push starts no CI run of its own, and branch
// protection guards merges into `main`, not tags. It used to read the check
// suite whose `head_branch` is `main` and accept `success` or `skipped` from it
// for all five names alike. Both halves of that are wrong at once, and they
// contradict each other:
//
//   - it refused the merge queue's suite as untrustworthy, in a comment that
//     measured `image-smoke` reporting `skipped` there and `e2e-postgres-smoke`
//     reporting a `success` with every step gated off by `RUN_HEAVY`;
//   - and then it accepted `test`, `race` and `e2e` off the push suite, where
//     ci.yml's `changes` job clears `run_core` UNCONDITIONALLY on the grounds
//     that the queue has already run them. Measured at 4b3c01d7: 4 s, 2 s and
//     4 s with every lane beneath them `skipped`. A green with no work behind
//     it, on every push, for reasons that have nothing to do with the commit.
//
// So each of the five had a verdict read off a run whose own gate never looked
// at that commit's diff. What the gate asks now is the same question per lane,
// aimed at the run where the lane actually executes: `test`, `race` and `e2e`
// at the `merge_group` run, which this rebase queue produces on the
// byte-identical SHA; `e2e-postgres-smoke` and `image-smoke` at the push,
// release or dispatch run, which is what their own `RUN_HEAVY` selects.
//
// The tests below run the gate's REAL shell — extracted from the workflow, over
// stubbed API responses — rather than restating its rules in Go. A guard that
// reimplements what it guards proves only that two copies agree, and the two
// copies drift; and this failure was silent for as long as it existed, because
// a release image nobody pulled is not a signal any workflow reads.
//
// The split is only correct while ci.yml still behaves the way it is read here,
// so that reading is asserted too — the two premises live in another file, and
// nothing else would notice them changing.
