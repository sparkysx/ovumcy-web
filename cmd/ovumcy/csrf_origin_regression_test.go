// The CSRF middleware validates the browser Origin (falling back to Referer)
// against the app-observed scheme+host on every mutating request. Until this
// file, nothing in Go exercised that control: the only other place the real
// csrfMiddlewareConfig is mounted (TestCSRFMiddlewareErrorHandlerLogsSecurityEvent-
// WithoutPII) runs with cookieSecure=false over a plain-HTTP posture, where the
// missing-Origin branch is deliberately inert — so the control that answers 403
// had no coverage at all, and its absence surfaced only as three dozen unrelated
// Playwright failures the first time the suite ran against HTTPS.
//
// Two things make the control invisible unless a test asks for them explicitly:
//   - It only refuses an ORIGIN-LESS request when the app observes https.
//     Over plain http fiber clears the error and proceeds.
//   - The app observes https only through the terminator's X-Forwarded-Proto,
//     which fiber reads only when the connection's peer is a trusted proxy
//     (TRUST_PROXY_ENABLED=true). Without that, COOKIE_SECURE=true alone
//     changes nothing here.
//
// Every test below therefore sends a VALID token plus its cookie, so a 403 can
// only come from the Origin/Referer control, and asserts the logged failure
// reason to prove it did not come from the token checks instead.
