// completion, OIDC callback, register pickup, recovery sign-in, and the
// in-place re-issue after a security-posture change) and the
// recovery-code rotations that seal their session before committing — so the

// An empty column means the owner never chose a language: nothing is written,
// and resolveRequestLanguage keeps deciding exactly as it did before the column
// existed. An unsupported stored code is treated the same way rather than
// normalized to the default — NormalizeLanguage would happily answer with the
// operator default for it, which would pin an account to a language nobody
// picked. Writing the cookie only for a value the shipped catalogue actually
// carries keeps an unknown code a no-op instead of a 500 or a wrong locale.

// each in-flight handoff carrying account-scoped state or a secret — recovery
// code, reset token, pending 2FA challenge, the pending TOTP enrollment secret,
// and the one-time calendar-feed subscribe URL.
//
// None of those is consumable without an authenticated session, so anything left
// behind is exposure with no remaining purpose. Both TOTP cookies are
// session-scoped (zero expires), so an abandoned enrollment would otherwise keep
// shipping its sealed raw secret at `path: "/"` for the rest of the browser
// session, and the feed URL stays a live capability the sign-out does not revoke.
// Retracting them here is what bounds that window, rather than waiting for some
// later request to happen to read and refuse the value.
//
// Cookies whose flow completes outside a session are deliberately absent: the
// OIDC one-time state cookie and the register-pickup handle are consumed by
// their own flow, and `ovumcy_flash` carries no secret. The OIDC STEP-UP cookie
// is absent for a second reason on top of that one — this helper also runs on a
// session REJECTION, and one of those can arrive on the callback itself, the
// single request that still needs the cookie — so only a deliberate end
// retracts it, through clearSessionEndCookies below. `ovumcy_lang`
// and `ovumcy_tz` are absent for a different reason again, and it is not an oversight:
// neither is sealed or session-scoped, and this helper also runs where a session
// is REJECTED rather than ended — an expired cookie on an ordinary request, or an
// unauthenticated probe. Retracting the language there would take the login
// page's language away from a visitor whose session merely lapsed, and would let
// anyone reset a browser's rendering language with one unauthenticated request.
// The deliberate ends clear both through clearSessionEndCookies below.

// clearSessionEndCookies retracts everything clearAuthRelatedCookies does, plus
// the two plaintext preference caches `ovumcy_lang` and `ovumcy_tz` and any
// pending flash. It is the
// helper for the paths where the owner ends the session ON PURPOSE — logout and
// account deletion — as opposed to the paths where the server refuses one it was
// handed.
//
// The split is the whole point. Neither cookie is sealed or scoped to a session:
// `ovumcy_lang` is a pre-auth cache of the account column, re-issued from it by
// setAuthCookie at every session issue, and `ovumcy_tz` is the browser's own
// timezone, re-issued by LanguageMiddleware from the request header. Left behind
// by a sign-out they disclose, on a shared or borrowed browser, that this app is
// used here, in which language, and from which region — before anyone has
// authenticated. Cleared on a session REJECTION they would instead be a nuisance
// an unauthenticated caller controls, and would cost a visitor whose session
// expired mid-use the language of the page they are looking at. Deliberate end
// clears them; refusal leaves them alone.
//
// The retraction of `ovumcy_tz` holds only because the client stops volunteering
// the timezone while signed out: app.js writes the cookie and attaches the
// X-Ovumcy-Timezone header only on a page rendered for a session (see
// signedInPage in web/src/js/app/00-core.js). Without that half the next page
// load — the login page this very sign-out redirects to — would put the cookie
// straight back, and this retraction would be theatre.
//
// The OIDC step-up cookie is here rather than in clearAuthRelatedCookies for
// the same reason: it names the owner a settings step-up would act for, and a
// session that has deliberately ended cannot complete one — while a session
// REJECTION may well arrive on the callback itself, which is the one request
// that still needs the cookie.
//
// The continuation cookie is the second carrier of that same authority, not a
// detail of the first: it seals the whole step-up state plus an authorization
// code nobody has spent yet, so a minute-old hand-off left by a cross-site
// return completes an erasure or a link for an owner who has since signed out.
// Retracting one carrier and not the other states the rule above at one of two
// places, which is not the rule.
