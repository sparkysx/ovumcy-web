// Package backuprestoredoc EXECUTES the backup and restore runbook in
// docs/self-hosted.md instead of trusting its prose.
//
// The runbook documents two procedures, one per storage engine, and makes a
// specific claim about each: the Postgres restore, with the schema dropped
// first and `psql` run under `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`, brings back every table,
// row and sequence the dump carried; the SQLite named-volume archive captures
// `ovumcy.db`, `ovumcy.db-wal` and `ovumcy.db-shm` together, and the restore
// puts them back. Until this package, both claims and all four destructive
// commands existed only as prose — a repository-wide search for `pg_dump`,
// `ON_ERROR_STOP`, the schema drop, `docker volume rm` or `tar xzf` matched
// documentation and the changelog, never a test, a script or a workflow — so a
// real incident would have been the first end-to-end run of either.
//
// The commands are therefore READ OUT OF THE DOCUMENT and executed verbatim
// against ephemeral resources. Nothing here restates a command as a Go string
// literal. What each half substitutes, and why the substitution is the thing
// that keeps a `go test ./...` on a self-hoster’s own machine away from a real
// deployment, is stated where it happens: composeExecPrefix below for Postgres,
// the volume name and the compose lifecycle bracket in volume_test.go, and
// refusedInAnExecutedCommand in shell_test.go, which refuses to run whatever a
// substitution missed. A drift between the prose an operator follows and a
// procedure that works is what turns this red.
//
// What the two halves cover:
//
//   - the documented `pg_dump` backup command, and the documented restore in
//     both its steps — dropping and recreating the `public` schema, then the
//     `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1` replay;
//   - the claim about what that restore leaves behind, over the application’s
//     own migrated schema and with a deliberately drifted intermediate
//     generation, so a restore that moved nothing cannot pass. What "the same
//     export" means, and the two differences that survive any restore, are
//     export_compare_test.go’s subject;
//   - the runbook’s own "data intact, or drifted since the backup" table row —
//     the restore that exits 0 having restored no row — as the counterfactual
//     that makes the drop step and ON_ERROR_STOP load-bearing rather than
//     decorative, down to the sequences it rewinds and the collision that
//     follows;
//   - the documented named-volume archive and restore (`tar czf` / `docker
//     volume rm` + `create` / `tar xzf`), against an ephemeral volume holding
//     the application’s own SQLite database, drifted the same three ways and
//     read back through the repositories;
//   - the whole-WAL-set claim: the fixture is written with the connection held
//     OPEN, so the rows are in `ovumcy.db-wal` rather than in the database
//     file, and an archive that missed the sidecars restores the clean, empty
//     instance the runbook’s Post-Restore Verification warns about.
//
// What stays outside, deliberately: `docker compose down` / `up -d` are
// asserted present in the restore block and then removed rather than run —
// this package never starts the application, it writes the volume and reads it
// back itself — and the operator-side checklist in Post-Restore Verification,
// which is performed against a running instance and cannot be seen from here.
// Two properties that CAN be seen from here are checked instead:
// TestPostRestoreVerificationPointsAtTheCalendarFeedNote and
// TestPostRestoreVerificationPointsAtTheErasureNote hold the checklist to the
// two cross-references an operator needs — and, for the second, to the
// specific claims docs/gdpr.md makes about what a restore does to data a
// clear-data or account-deletion request already removed — since nothing else
// enforces either.
