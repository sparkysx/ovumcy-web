// runbookCommandTimeout bounds one documented command. Every step here is a
// dump, an archive or a replay of a fixture-sized database against a container
// on the same host: a step that has not finished inside this budget is hung,

// and that MUST have been substituted away before execution, so the check is
// not a style rule but the thing that keeps `go test ./...` on a developer's
// own machine from reaching a real deployment:
//
//   - `docker compose` would address the operator's compose project — the
//     running application, its database, its volumes;
//   - `ovumcy_data` is the operator's real data volume, and the restore the
//     runbook documents begins by DELETING it. A run that got this far with the
//     literal intact would destroy a self-hoster's health data on a machine
//     where the guard was only supposed to read a document.
//
// Each caller substitutes for its own reasons — an ephemeral container, an
// ephemeral volume — and this refuses to run whatever a substitution missed.
