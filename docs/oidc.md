# OIDC / SSO Guide

This guide documents Ovumcy's optional OpenID Connect sign-in for self-hosters who already run a central identity provider.

Use this page together with [README.md](../README.md) and [docs/self-hosted.md](self-hosted.md):

- `README.md` stays the short product and configuration overview.
- `docs/self-hosted.md` defines the supported deployment contract.
- this page explains the OIDC-specific operator setup, provider recipes, rollout guidance, and troubleshooting.

## Current Contract

Ovumcy's OIDC support is optional, but the contract is broader than the first hybrid release:

- sign-in uses server-side Authorization Code + PKCE; `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=form_post` (the default) has the provider auto-POST the code, while `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` is an opt-in for providers that can only return the code as a URL query redirect (see [Response mode](#response-mode));
- `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE=hybrid` keeps local username/password available alongside SSO;
- `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE=oidc_only` closes the public local login, register, and forgot-password routes server-side — `Login`, `Register`, and `ForgotPassword` refuse the request (`403` for JSON/HTMX, a flash-carrying redirect to `/login` for a page load) before doing anything else, so this is a closed route, not merely a button removed from the page;
- the first successful OIDC sign-in uses an existing `(issuer, subject)` link when present; a verified email claim that matches an existing local account does **not** link automatically — the callback refuses and redirects to `/login`; completing the link needs the account's current password to start a Settings step-up and a fresh interactive re-authentication at the provider to finish (no separate TOTP challenge — the provider re-authentication substitutes for it; see [How Sign-In Works](#how-sign-in-works)), because otherwise any provider able to assert someone's email address could take over their account;
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=true` may create a new `owner` account only when `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`;
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` can restrict auto-provisioning to a comma-separated domain allowlist;
- auto-provisioned accounts start without a local password or recovery code;
- users who need recovery codes or password-confirmed sensitive actions must set a local password later in `Settings`;
- successful OIDC sign-in still ends with the normal local `ovumcy_auth` cookie, so the rest of the app keeps using the existing session model;
- logout can stay local or redirect to the provider's `end_session_endpoint`, depending on `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` and the provider metadata.

## Required Environment

Use the following variables together:

```env
COOKIE_SECURE=true
OIDC_ENABLED=true
OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://id.example.com
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=ovumcy
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=replace_with_a_client_secret
OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback
OIDC_CA_FILE=/run/certs/oidc-provider-ca.pem
OIDC_LOGIN_MODE=hybrid
OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=form_post
OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=false
OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS=
OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE=local
OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=https://ovumcy.example.com/login
```

Notes:

- `COOKIE_SECURE=true` is mandatory when `OIDC_ENABLED=true`.
- `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` must be an absolute `https://` URL and its path must be exactly `/auth/oidc/callback`.
- `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` must be the issuer URL itself, not a browser login page URL and not a URL with query parameters or fragments.
- Every configured OIDC URL must name a host. `https://:8443`, `https://0.0.0.0:8443` and `https://[::]:8443` are rejected at startup: they parse as valid
  URLs but resolve to the machine Ovumcy runs on, which would send the client secret and the authorization code to whatever listens on that port. A real
  hostname or a concrete address — `127.0.0.1` included — is required, written in plain dotted-quad form: a numeric host such as `0`, `0.1`, `00.0.0.0`,
  `0x0` or `192.168.001.010` is rejected too, because a platform resolver may read it as a different address than it appears to name. A host
  containing any non-ASCII character (for example the full-width `０.０.０.０`) is rejected as well: HTTP clients and browsers map such a host to ASCII
  before connecting, so what it reaches cannot be checked from its spelling. An internationalized domain works in its ASCII `xn--` form.
  The same requirement applies to the `authorization_endpoint` your provider advertises
  in its discovery document, which must additionally be present and an absolute `https://` URL; a document that omits it or fails the check leaves SSO
  unavailable rather than sending the browser to that URL.
- Every endpoint the provider's discovery document advertises and Ovumcy uses — `authorization_endpoint`, `token_endpoint`, `jwks_uri` and
  `end_session_endpoint` — must be on the issuer's origin: the same scheme, host and port as `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`. A provider whose sign-in page
  lives on another host (for example a separate `login.` subdomain) is refused when Ovumcy loads its discovery document, and SSO stays
  unavailable until `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` names an issuer whose endpoints share its origin. An `end_session_endpoint` on another origin is dropped, so
  sign-out stays local. A stored provider-logout target is checked against the issuer configured now, so after the issuer's origin (scheme, host or port)
  changes, a sign-out from a session started before the change is local only; a change that keeps the origin (for example another
  realm on the same host) does not affect it. The address the provider returns the browser to after sign-out is always the one
  configured now (`OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, or `/login` on the `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` origin), never one saved with the session.
- `OIDC_CA_FILE` is optional. Use it only when the provider certificate chain is signed by a private or internal CA that the Ovumcy runtime does not already trust.
- `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE` must be `hybrid` or `oidc_only`.
- `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE` must be `form_post` (default) or `query`. Leave it at `form_post` unless your provider cannot form-post the callback (see [Response mode](#response-mode)).
- `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` must be `local`, `provider`, or `auto`.
- `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, when set, must be on the same origin as `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`, and it must not contain query parameters or fragments.
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=true` requires `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`.
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is optional. When present, it must be a comma-separated list such as `example.com,staff.example.com`.

## How Sign-In Works

1. The login page shows a `Log in with SSO` button when `OIDC_ENABLED=true`.
2. Ovumcy starts a server-side Authorization Code flow with PKCE and writes a sealed one-time state cookie containing the OIDC `state`, `nonce`, PKCE verifier, and expiry timestamp.
3. The identity provider authenticates the user and returns the browser to `/auth/oidc/callback` — an auto-POST of the `code` and `state` in the request body (`form_post`, the default) or a `GET` redirect carrying them in the URL query (`query`). Ovumcy reads the callback from exactly one source keyed by the mode; it never reads both.
4. Ovumcy validates the sealed state, exchanges the authorization code for tokens, and verifies the ID token plus `nonce`.
5. If the `(issuer, subject)` identity link already exists, the linked local account is used immediately.
6. Otherwise, if a verified email claim matches an existing local account, Ovumcy **neither links the two nor signs the user in**. It redirects to `/login` with a message pointing the account holder at Settings: sign in with your existing method, then link the new identity from there.
   There is no unauthenticated way to complete this link — the public `/auth/oidc/link-confirm` route that used to accept a password on this page was removed for good (WEB-77). Without this gate, any provider able to assert an existing user's email address could take over their account.
   The invariant itself — why an email claim is never enough, the two authorised linking paths (Settings step-up, operator CLI), and why the old public route is gone rather than merely closed — is owned by [docs/security/oidc-and-sessions.md](security/oidc-and-sessions.md); this page keeps the operator-facing flow.
7. If no account exists and auto-provisioning is enabled, Ovumcy can create a new `owner` account, subject to `REGISTRATION_MODE=open` and any configured domain allowlist. A brand-new account has nothing to take over, so no confirmation applies.
8. Ovumcy finishes sign-in by issuing the normal local `ovumcy_auth` session cookie for a path that resolved to a session (steps 5 and 7); step 6 never mints one on its own.

Provider and auth errors are intentionally kept out of query strings and fragments. Browser-facing failures return through the existing flash-based login UX instead. (In `query` response mode the provider itself puts the successful `code`/`state` in the callback URL — see [Response mode](#response-mode) — but Ovumcy still never emits its own error state into a URL.)

### Linking and unlinking from Settings

- **Link:** `Settings` → the connected sign-in identity card. Enter the account's current password, then confirm at the provider. An account without a local password cannot link another identity until it sets one.
- **Unlink:** the same card lists every linked identity by issuer and link date; each row has an **Unlink** button that asks for the current password and a confirmation. The last way into an account cannot be removed: an account's only identity stays linked unless local password sign-in is set up and allowed (`OIDC_LOGIN_MODE=hybrid`).
- Linking and unlinking both sign out every other session of the account.
- `email_verified` plays no part in linking: the identity is the `(issuer, subject)` pair, bound from a password-confirmed session.
- A password change or reset does not remove linked identities; unlink one explicitly.
- A provider whose ID tokens lack `sub` or `iss` cannot sign anyone in.

## Response mode

`OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE` selects how the provider returns the authorization code on the callback:

- `form_post` (**default**): the provider auto-POSTs `code`/`state` in the request body to `POST /auth/oidc/callback`. Nothing auth-sensitive lands in a URL. Use this whenever your provider supports it.
- `query`: the provider returns `code`/`state` as a `GET` redirect to `/auth/oidc/callback?...`. This is an **explicit opt-in** for providers that cannot form-post — for example [better-auth](#better-auth), [Dex](#dex), and Pocket ID older than 2.7.0.

Why `query` is safe despite putting the code in the URL: Ovumcy's sign-in is Authorization Code **+ PKCE**. The authorization code is useless on its own — redeeming it requires the PKCE verifier, which never leaves the sealed, `HttpOnly` state cookie and is never placed in any URL. So a code captured from a URL (browser history, a reverse-proxy access log) cannot be exchanged. The trade-off is purely log hygiene:

- the code appears in any component that logs full request URLs (reverse proxies, the browser's own history);
- **restrict access to those logs** and prefer short log-retention on the proxy fronting Ovumcy;
- Ovumcy's own request log masks the callback and never records the code, and the CSRF exemption for the callback is unchanged — the `GET` callback is a safe method the CSRF middleware never validates and is protected by the same sealed one-time `state`/`nonce`/PKCE cookie as the `POST` callback.

Prefer `form_post`; reach for `query` only when the provider gives you no choice.

### A provider on another site

Nothing has to be configured for this, but it is worth knowing what happens. When the provider is served from a different registrable site than Ovumcy — the usual case for a hosted IdP — the browser treats the `form_post` callback as a cross-site `POST` and withholds the session cookie from it, which is exactly what `SameSite=Lax` is for. A step-up (linking an identity, setting a first local password, clearing data, deleting the account) has to know *whose* re-authentication just came back, so the callback answers with a small same-origin page that immediately navigates to `/auth/oidc/callback/continue`, where the session cookie is delivered and the action finishes.

What this means in practice:

- the hop is internal — there is no extra redirect URI to register with the provider, and `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` is unchanged;
- the hand-off between the two legs is a sealed, `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookie scoped to that one path, usable once, and expiring after a minute;
- if a reverse proxy in front of Ovumcy filters paths, `/auth/oidc/callback/continue` has to reach the app like the rest of `/auth/oidc/`;
- an ordinary sign-in is unaffected, and so is any callback from a provider on the same site as Ovumcy: both complete on the callback itself;
- a cross-site step-up takes the hop in `query` mode too: the return is classified by where it came from, not by response mode;
- a refusal takes the same hop, so where the owner lands does not depend on how her browser treats a redirect begun on another site.

The hop is chosen from the `Sec-Fetch-Site` request header, which the browser sets and page script cannot forge. A proxy in front of Ovumcy that strips `Sec-` headers therefore hides a cross-site return: the step-up then refuses with "that re-authentication does not match the account signed in here". If step-ups fail that way against a cross-site provider, check that the proxy passes `Sec-Fetch-Site` through.

A browser that never sends the header reaches the same dead end for the same reason — anything older than Chrome 76, Firefox 90 or Safari 16.4. An absent header is read as *nothing stated*, never as *cross-site*, which is the rule Ovumcy applies to Fetch Metadata everywhere: a missing header may not be the thing that decides, because a proxy forwarding part of the family and dropping the rest would otherwise change how requests are handled rather than merely how they are labelled. The consequence is worth stating plainly: on such a browser, a step-up against a provider on another site cannot complete. Signing in is unaffected, and so is every step-up against a provider on Ovumcy's own site.

## How Auto-Provision Works

Auto-provision is intentionally narrow:

- it creates `owner` accounts only;
- it requires a verified email claim;
- it is denied when `REGISTRATION_MODE=closed`;
- it is denied when `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is set and the email domain is not on the allowlist;
- it creates the user without a local password or recovery code.

That last point is important. An auto-provisioned OIDC-only account can use the app immediately, but:

- local password recovery is not available yet;
- recovery-code regeneration is not available yet;
- password-confirmed sensitive actions such as recovery-code regeneration stay blocked until the user sets a local password in `Settings`. **Erasure is the exception**: `clear data` and `delete account` are available without one, confirmed at the provider through the step-up flow described below.

To enable a local password, OIDC-only users go through a **step-up re-authentication flow**:

1. The user fills the "set local password" form in `Settings`. The browser submits to `POST /api/v1/users/current/password/step-up`, which validates the password, prepares its bcrypt hash without touching the database, and redirects the browser to the provider's authorize endpoint with `prompt=login` and `max_age=0` so the provider is forced to re-authenticate the user interactively.
2. The provider posts the result back to the existing `/auth/oidc/callback` endpoint. Ovumcy detects the step-up flow (via a sealed cookie issued in step 1), runs the OIDC code exchange, and requires the resulting ID token's `auth_time` claim to lie within the last five minutes (see [Provider requirement for step-up](#provider-requirement-for-step-up-auth_time)) and the returned `(issuer, subject)` pair to already be linked to the current session's user.
3. Only after both checks succeed does Ovumcy persist the prepared password hash, mint a fresh recovery code, and present it on the dedicated `/recovery-code` page. A stale or mismatched re-auth leaves the account untouched.

The `PUT /api/v1/users/current/password` endpoint still works for accounts that already have local auth enabled (ordinary password rotation). For accounts with `LocalAuthEnabled=false` it returns `403 oidc reauth required` so the step-up flow above is the only path to enrol a local password.

### Erasure without a local password

Erasing health data always costs a fresh re-authentication. An account provisioned through OIDC has no password to satisfy that with, so it satisfies it at the provider instead, through the same step-up primitive:

1. The owner confirms the action in `Settings → Danger zone`. The browser submits to `POST /api/v1/users/current/data-wipe/step-up` or `POST /api/v1/users/current/deletion/step-up`, which seals **which** erasure was confirmed into the step-up cookie and redirects to the provider exactly as step 1 above does. Nothing is erased at this point.
2. The provider posts back to `/auth/oidc/callback`, which runs the same freshness and identity checks as the local-password flow.
3. Only then does the erasure run — the operation taken from the sealed state, never from the callback request, which arrives from the provider carrying no body of its own.

An account that **has** a local password is refused both endpoints with `400 invalid settings input`: its erasure gate is the password, and the SSO route must never become a way around it.

### Provider requirement for step-up: `auth_time`

All three step-ups — erasure, enrolling a local password, and linking an identity from `Settings` — accept the provider's answer only if its ID token carries an `auth_time` claim from the last five minutes. `iat` is never used in its place: it dates the token, not the sign-in, so a provider that answers `prompt=login` from a cached session would mint a fresh `iat` over a stale authentication. OpenID Connect Core makes `auth_time` required whenever `max_age` is requested, and Ovumcy always sends `max_age=0` on a step-up, so a conformant provider is unaffected. There is no setting to relax this.

Consequence: **a provider that omits `auth_time` under `max_age=0` cannot complete any of the three step-ups.** On such a provider an OIDC-only account cannot clear its data, delete itself or enrol a local password, and no account — with a local password or without — can link another identity from `Settings`; every attempt returns to `Settings` and changes nothing. That refusal is its own message — it says the provider did not report when the sign-in happened and that retrying cannot help — and it is distinct from the "too old, sign in again" refusal a provider that *does* send `auth_time` produces. The audit stream separates them the same way: the same `denied` outcome on the step-up's action, with `reason="oidc reauth auth_time missing"` for this case and `reason="oidc reauth stale"` for a sign-in that simply took too long, so a non-conforming provider is visible in the log without asking the owner what she saw. Ordinary SSO sign-in is unaffected — it never checks `auth_time`. None of the rows in the [compatibility matrix](#provider-compatibility-matrix) has been verified against this requirement; check your provider by decoding an ID token it issues for a `max_age=0` request. The operator commands need no step-up: `ovumcy link-oidc-identity` links an identity, and `ovumcy users delete` erases an account on its owner's behalf (see [GDPR](gdpr.md)).

## How Logout Works

`OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` controls what happens after Ovumcy clears its own auth cookies:

- `local`: clear Ovumcy cookies only, then return to `/login`;
- `provider`: if the provider session metadata includes `end_session_endpoint`, redirect there with `id_token_hint` and `post_logout_redirect_uri`; otherwise Ovumcy falls back to local logout. The post-logout address must be on the same origin (scheme, host, port) as `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`; one that is not is never sent to the provider, and sign-out completes locally;
- `auto`: same behavior as `provider`, but intended as the default "best effort" setting for operators who want provider logout when available without breaking logout on providers that do not publish an end-session endpoint.

If you want provider logout, keep `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL` on the same public origin as the callback URL. If you leave it empty, Ovumcy defaults to your public `/login` URL.

A change to `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` takes effect on the next sign-out, including for sessions that began before the change. Ovumcy stores the provider material a sign-out would need (the `end_session_endpoint` and the `id_token_hint`) with the session, and that record can outlive the setting by up to seven days — but it is only the data for the hop, never the decision to make it. After you switch to `local`, or turn OIDC off, every sign-out is local and the stored record is discarded as the session ends.

Ovumcy host-pins the discovery-supplied `end_session_endpoint` to the configured `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` (same scheme, host, and effective port). If a provider advertises an end-session endpoint on a different origin — for example a compromised or look-alike discovery document — Ovumcy rejects it at provider load and silently falls back to local logout, regardless of `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE`. This prevents a malicious metadata response from redirecting the logout flow (including any `id_token_hint` carried in the URL) to an attacker-controlled host. The pin also applies to a discovery document that Ovumcy can only decode in part: sign-in still works, and an end-session endpoint that fails the pin degrades to local logout exactly as a missing one does.

## Accepted Signing Algorithms

Ovumcy verifies provider ID tokens with an explicit asymmetric-algorithm allowlist: `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`, `ES512`, `PS256`, `PS384`, `PS512`, and `EdDSA`. Symmetric algorithms (`HS*`) and the `none` algorithm are rejected even if the provider advertises them, so an attacker who controls discovery metadata cannot downgrade verification into an algorithm-confusion path that treats a known-public JWKS key as a shared HMAC secret. If your provider only supports something outside this list, sign-in will fail closed and the operator must reconfigure the upstream IdP.

## Provider Recipes

The exact UI labels differ a little by provider version, but the stable requirements are the same:

- callback URL: `https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback`
- client type: confidential web application
- response type / flow: authorization code
- claims: the provider must supply a stable `sub` and a verified email when you want first-login email matching or auto-provisioning

## Provider Compatibility Matrix

The matrix below reflects real interoperability checks under Ovumcy's current hardened browser callback model.

Important caveats — read these before relying on any row in the table:

- "Verified" in this document means **manually exercised in a local test stack** — `docker-compose` standing up the upstream provider image on the same network as a local Ovumcy build, hitting the real OIDC code path. It does **not** mean integration-tested in CI, and it does **not** mean validated against a production identity deployment with custom claim mappings, organization-specific policies, reverse-proxy front-ends, custom CAs, or non-default scopes.
- Ovumcy does not pin or run automated integration tests against specific provider versions. The matrix records manual checks performed during the indicated release window — re-verify whenever you upgrade your identity provider across major versions.
- The v0.9.5 hardening (host-pinning of the discovery-supplied `end_session_endpoint` and the asymmetric-only signing-algorithm allowlist) was validated against a synthetic OIDC provider in `internal/security/oidc_runtime_poc_test.go`. Re-verification of every provider row against those two contracts is not part of CI; report any regressions through [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
- "Last verified in" is the Ovumcy release tag at which the local-test-stack check was last run, not the provider version. Provider versions used during verification were the then-current upstream stable docker images at that time.

| Provider | Sign-in status | Logout status | Last verified in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keycloak | Verified supported | Verified provider logout | v0.8.0 | Full browser sign-in, account resolution, and provider logout were verified end-to-end. |
| authentik | Verified supported | Verified provider-managed logout | v0.8.0 | Sign-in is supported. Provider logout may show an authentik-managed invalidation screen before the provider session fully ends. |
| Authelia | Verified supported | Local-only fallback | v0.8.0 | Sign-in is supported. Authelia does not currently expose `end_session_endpoint`, so Ovumcy clears its own session and returns to `/login`. |
| ZITADEL | Supported with the full official deployment | Provider logout depends on the full deployment | v0.8.0 | Discovery metadata and app setup are compatible, but browser sign-in requires the full ZITADEL deployment that includes the separate Login UI application under `/ui/v2/login`. |
| better-auth | Supported with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` | Not verified | — | better-auth returns `code`/`state` as a URL query redirect and does not form-post. Set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`; the code in the URL is inert without the PKCE verifier. Mind reverse-proxy/browser logs — see [Response mode](#response-mode). |
| Dex | Supported with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` | Not verified | v0.8.0 (form_post unsupported) | Dex returns `code`/`state` in the callback URL query and does not form-post, so it was previously unsupported. Set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` to sign in; the code in the URL is inert without the PKCE verifier. Mind reverse-proxy/browser logs — see [Response mode](#response-mode). |
| Pocket ID (2.7.0+) | Reported supported, re-verification pending | Not re-verified | v0.8.0 (pre-2.7.0) | Pocket ID 2.7.0 added `response_mode=form_post` support upstream. [#62](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/issues/62) reports that sign-in works end-to-end against Ovumcy 0.9.5. Ovumcy has not re-verified Pocket ID 2.7.0 in its local test stack; logout has not been independently checked. Pocket ID versions older than 2.7.0 can instead sign in with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`. |

### Query-only providers (Dex, better-auth, older Pocket ID)

Ovumcy prefers `response_mode=form_post` so auth-sensitive transport data such as `code`, `state`, and provider error details stay out of user-visible URLs. Some providers — Dex, better-auth, and Pocket ID older than 2.7.0 — return the callback as a URL query redirect and cannot form-post. These were previously unsupported.

They now work with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`. This does not weaken the security model: the callback still exchanges an Authorization Code **+ PKCE**, and the code in the URL is inert without the PKCE verifier, which never leaves the sealed `HttpOnly` state cookie. The only cost is log hygiene — the code appears in components that log full request URLs — so restrict access to reverse-proxy access logs and keep their retention short. See [Response mode](#response-mode) for the full rationale.

Pocket ID 2.7.0+ can use the default `form_post` instead; see the [Pocket ID](#pocket-id) section below.

### Pocket ID

Pocket ID 2.7.0 added `response_mode=form_post` support upstream, and issue [#62](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/issues/62) reports that sign-in works end-to-end against Ovumcy 0.9.5 with Pocket ID 2.7.0.

Treat this row as **community-reported, re-verification pending**:

- Ovumcy has not yet re-verified Pocket ID 2.7.0 in its local test stack, so the matrix does not promote it to `Verified supported`.
- Logout behavior at 2.7.0 has not been independently exercised; pin `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE=local` if you need a predictable outcome until that is checked.
- Pocket ID versions older than 2.7.0 return auth-sensitive callback parameters in the browser URL instead of form-posting; they can sign in with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` (mind reverse-proxy/browser logs — see [Response mode](#response-mode)) or you can upgrade to 2.7.0+ and use the default `form_post`.

Operators choosing Pocket ID 2.7.0+ should treat the integration as community-supported until a future Ovumcy release tag updates the "Last verified in" column for this row.

### Authentik

Recommended setup:

1. Create an Application and an OAuth2/OpenID Provider for Ovumcy.
2. Register the exact Ovumcy callback URL in the provider redirect URI list instead of relying on first-visit auto-save behavior.
3. Use a confidential client with a generated secret.
4. Make sure the provider exposes a verified email claim for users who should sign in.
5. Use the application-specific issuer URL for `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, not the generic site root.

Recommended Ovumcy mapping:

```env
OIDC_ISSUER_URL=https://authentik.example.com/application/o/ovumcy/
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=ovumcy
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=replace_with_a_client_secret
OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback
```

### better-auth

better-auth returns the authorization `code`/`state` as a URL query redirect (`GET /auth/oidc/callback?...`) and does not form-post. Set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` to sign in.

Recommended setup:

1. Register Ovumcy as a confidential OIDC/OAuth2 client with the authorization code flow.
2. Set the redirect URI to the exact Ovumcy callback URL `https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback`.
3. Ensure the provider issues a stable `sub` and a verified email claim.
4. On the Ovumcy side set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` and review the log-hygiene note in [Response mode](#response-mode).

### Dex

Dex returns `code` and `state` in a query-based callback (`GET /auth/oidc/callback?...`) and does not support `response_mode=form_post`. It was previously unsupported; it now works with `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`.

Recommended setup:

1. Register a Dex static client for Ovumcy with the authorization code flow.
2. Set the redirect URI to the exact Ovumcy callback URL `https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback`.
3. Ensure the client scopes include `openid` and `email` so first-login email matching works.
4. On the Ovumcy side set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`; the code in the URL is inert without the PKCE verifier, but review the log-hygiene note in [Response mode](#response-mode).

### Keycloak

Recommended setup:

1. Create or choose a realm for Ovumcy.
2. Create a new OpenID Connect client for a web application.
3. Keep the authorization code flow enabled and use a confidential client with a secret.
4. Set `Valid Redirect URIs` to the exact Ovumcy callback URL.
5. Use the realm issuer URL for `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, for example:
   `https://keycloak.example.com/realms/ovumcy`

### Authelia

Authelia configures OIDC clients in its own configuration file. Keep the raw client secret for Ovumcy and the digest only in Authelia's config.

Authelia sign-in is compatible with Ovumcy's callback contract. Logout should still be treated as local-only fallback unless your deployed Authelia build starts publishing a usable `end_session_endpoint`.

Typical client skeleton:

```yaml
identity_providers:
  oidc:
    clients:
      - client_id: "ovumcy"
        client_name: "Ovumcy"
        client_secret: "digest-of-the-raw-client-secret"
        public: false
        redirect_uris:
          - "https://ovumcy.example.com/auth/oidc/callback"
        scopes:
          - "openid"
          - "email"
        response_types:
          - "code"
        grant_types:
          - "authorization_code"
```

### ZITADEL

Recommended setup:

1. Use the full official ZITADEL deployment that includes the separate Login UI application under `/ui/v2/login`.
2. Create a Web Application in your ZITADEL project.
3. Choose the authorization code flow with a client secret.
4. Register the exact Ovumcy callback URL.
5. Use the public issuer root URL for `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`.

Do not treat the minimal API-only compose path as enough for browser sign-in. In practice, ZITADEL's browser login flow depends on the Login UI application being deployed and reachable.

## Rollout Checklist

Before enabling OIDC for real users:

1. Decide whether the instance should start in `hybrid` or `oidc_only`.
   For the first rollout, `hybrid` is safer because local login stays available during testing.
2. Confirm the provider sends the same verified email you expect for your first operator account.
3. Test a first login that creates or links the identity.
4. Test a second login to confirm the stored `(issuer, subject)` link is used.
5. If auto-provisioning is enabled, test one allowed-domain account and one denied-domain account.
6. If auto-provisioned users should be able to recover locally later, test the `Settings -> Set local password` flow and confirm a recovery code is issued.
7. If provider logout is enabled, test both:
   - a provider that exposes `end_session_endpoint`;
   - a fallback case where Ovumcy still clears the local session cleanly.

## Troubleshooting

### The SSO button does not appear

Check:

- `OIDC_ENABLED=true` is present in the running environment;
- startup did not reject another OIDC variable;
- the instance was restarted after changing env;
- `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE` is not mis-typed.

### Startup fails with `OIDC_ENABLED=true requires COOKIE_SECURE=true`

This is expected. OIDC requires secure cookies, so serve Ovumcy over HTTPS and set:

```env
COOKIE_SECURE=true
```

### Startup fails with `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=true requires REGISTRATION_MODE=open`

This is expected. Automatic account creation is intentionally coupled to open registration mode so operators do not silently bypass their registration policy.

### Startup fails with an `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE`, `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE`, or post-logout validation error

Check:

- `OIDC_LOGIN_MODE` is exactly `hybrid` or `oidc_only`;
- `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` is exactly `local`, `provider`, or `auto`;
- `OIDC_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL`, if set, uses `https://`, stays on the same origin as `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`, and does not contain query parameters or fragments.

### The provider rejects the callback URL

Typical causes:

- the provider client registration uses a different hostname;
- the provider has `http://` registered but Ovumcy is configured with `https://`;
- the provider has a trailing slash mismatch or a different callback path.

Fix it by making the provider's registered redirect URI exactly match `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`.

### Clicking SSO returns to `/login` with a generic error

This usually means Ovumcy could not complete provider discovery or token exchange.

Check:

- `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` points to the real issuer, not to a login form URL;
- the provider is reachable from the Ovumcy host or container;
- the provider certificate chain is trusted by the Ovumcy runtime, or `OIDC_CA_FILE` points to a readable PEM bundle for your private CA;
- reverse-proxy DNS and firewall rules allow Ovumcy to reach the provider;
- the provider's discovery document, key set (JWKS) and token response each stay under 512 KiB, with under 64 KiB of response headers. Ovumcy refuses a larger response outright rather than truncating it. Real providers answer in a few KiB, so hitting either limit points at a proxy or captive portal answering in the provider's place, or at a misbehaving provider.

### Auto-provision does not happen

Check:

- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=true`;
- `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`;
- the provider marks the email as verified;
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` is empty, or the email domain is listed there exactly.

### SSO resolves to an existing account but does not sign the user in

This is the account-link hand-off, not a failure. It happens once for each new
provider identity being attached to an existing account: the provider asserted an
email that matches an existing local account, and Ovumcy refuses to link a fresh
`(issuer, subject)` to an existing account on the strength of an email claim alone.
The user lands back on `/login` with a message pointing them at Settings.

To finish the link:

- **With a working sign-in already** (local password, or a different already-linked
  OIDC identity): sign in normally, open **Settings**, and use **Link an OIDC
  identity**. This starts a fresh interactive re-authentication at the provider
  (`prompt=login`) — the same step-up primitive local-password enrollment and the
  clear-data/delete-account flows already use — and links on return.
- **With no working sign-in at all** (an OIDC-only account whose provider changed,
  for example): the operator runs `ovumcy link-oidc-identity <email>|--id <id>
  --issuer <issuer> --subject <subject>` from the machine `docker compose exec` reaches.
  A new link signs out every session the account had open, on this path as on
  the Settings one.

Things worth knowing before treating it as a bug:

- There is no unauthenticated page that completes this link, at any password
  strength. That page (`/auth/oidc/link-confirm`) existed once and was removed for
  good (WEB-77) — see [docs/security/oidc-and-sessions.md](security/oidc-and-sessions.md).
- The link is refused outright if another account claimed the same
  `(issuer, subject)` in the meantime, on both paths above.
- There is no configuration switch that skips this. Auto-linking by asserted email
  is the account-takeover vector the gate exists to close.

### The user can sign in but cannot regenerate a recovery code or use password-confirmed danger-zone actions

This is expected for auto-provisioned OIDC-only accounts until the user sets a local password in `Settings`.

After a local password is set:

- local recovery becomes available;
- recovery-code generation becomes available;
- password-confirmed sensitive actions become available.

### Logout clears Ovumcy but does not sign the user out of the provider

This usually means one of these is true:

- `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE=local`;
- the provider does not publish `end_session_endpoint` in discovery metadata;
- the current session does not have enough provider logout data for `id_token_hint`.

In that case, Ovumcy still performs a safe local logout and redirects back to `/login`.

### Sign-in returns to `/login` with a provider that only supports query callbacks (Dex, better-auth, Pocket ID older than 2.7.0)

These providers return `code`/`state` in the callback URL query instead of form-posting. With the default `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=form_post`, Ovumcy reads the callback from the request body and finds nothing, so sign-in fails closed.

Set `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query` and restart. Ovumcy then serves the callback over `GET` and reads it from the query. The code in the URL is inert without the PKCE verifier (never in transport), but the code does appear in reverse-proxy/browser logs — see [Response mode](#response-mode). Pocket ID 2.7.0+ can instead use the default `form_post`.
