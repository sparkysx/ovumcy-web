// plainAuthFormPagePaths enumerates the plain (no HTMX, no JavaScript
// interception assumed) browser-form auth routes whose CSRF refusal (an idle
// or rotated token) or transport-level rejection (raised before any handler
// runs, so before a domain spec exists to route through respondAuthError) must
// answer as the page-form refusal page (the shared layout around the localized
// status, sendPageFormRefusalPage) rather than the JSON envelope — the same
// answer POST /lang gives (WEB-84, WEB-264). A plain <form> action is the route
// key, not the page it renders on.
//
// No OIDC route is a member: /auth/oidc/start, /auth/oidc/callback and the
// logout bridge are none of them a page a browser submits (start and the
// bridge are GET-only; the callback is CSRF-exempt, protected instead by the
// sealed one-time state cookie), and /auth/oidc/link-confirm carries no entry
// either — that route is unreachable today and a sibling issue removes it.
//
// Deliberately absent: POST /logout and DELETE /api/v1/sessions/current. Both
// answer the mapped envelope today for a plain browser Accept, and WEB-84
// leaves that unchanged — logout's own answer (it is not a page a refusal can
// re-render: DELETE has no <form>, and POST /logout replaces the page the
// owner was already looking at) is a decision for its own issue.

// a fixed mapping every refusal here would link to "/" instead of back to the
// form the owner was on. Every key here is also a key of plainAuthFormPagePaths;
