// interstitialHelper is the one function that turns a browser hop to the IdP
// into a same-origin 200 page. Reaching it from a route's handler chain is the
// positive witness this guard is built on.
const interstitialHelper = "oidcSameOriginRedirectInterstitial"

// TestOpenAPIOperationsServingAnInterstitialDeclareNoBrowserRedirect closes the
// one over-declaration this spec CAN decide without proving a negative.
//
// Over-declaration is generally undecidable here, which is why
// TestOpenAPIOperationsDeclareEveryStatusTheirOwnHandlerChainCanEmit is
// one-directional: "no path reaches this status" is not provable by a
// call-graph approximation failing to find one. This guard never asks that.
// It asks the opposite, positive question — does the chain reach
// oidcSameOriginRedirectInterstitial? — and a hit is a witness, not an absence.
//
// A hit settles the browser answer completely. The helper exists because CSP
// pins form-action to 'self' across a form navigation's whole redirect chain,
// so the cross-origin hop to the provider cannot be a 3xx at all; the operation
// hands the browser a 200 same-origin page whose meta-refresh performs it. An
// operation that serves it therefore has no browser redirect to declare, and
// the 303 three OIDC step-ups published described a hop that had not existed
// since the CSP fix. The one status they really can redirect a browser with is
// respondSettingsError's refusal bounce to /settings, shared by the settings
// mutations under /api/v1/users/current: of the operations the spec publishes
// under that prefix, the only ones declaring a 303 are those where the
// redirect IS the browser's primary outcome — a cross-cutting HTML-surface
// answer the spec preamble puts outside this contract, not a per-operation one.
//
// Neither status guard could see this. The whole-server sweep passes because
// 303 is emitted all over internal/; the per-operation walk passes because 303
// really is reachable here, just not for the declared reason. The falsehood
// lived in the response DESCRIPTION, and nothing in this package reads one.
