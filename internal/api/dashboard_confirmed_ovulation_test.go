// seedLateThermalShiftCycle records the late-shift cohort behind both halves of
// its regression (the JSON overview and the rendered dashboard slot): three
// prior 28-day cycles fix the median at 28 and the fourth start opens the
// CURRENT cycle, so the model projects a next period the recorded shift then
// straddles. The recorded series never moves — the coverline window is
// today-8..today-3 and the elevated streak today-2..today — so the detector
// names today-3 in both cases; what moves is the model's own projection, slid
// back by daysPastProjection:
//
//	0 — the cycle opens at today-31 (cycle day 32), the next period is projected
//	    on today-3, and the confirmed day falls ON that projected start;
//	1 — the cycle opens at today-32 (cycle day 33, still <= 28+7 and so not
//	    overdue), the next period is projected on today-4, and the confirmed day
//	    falls a day AFTER it.
//
// BOTH rows were red before the fix, and for two reasons at once. A detector
// bounded at the projection sees a coverline window one reading short — five of
// the six on row 0, four on row 1, where six are needed either way — AND the
// elevated triple today-2..today falls outside that bound entirely, so there was
// no streak inside the series to measure against a window in the first place.
// Row 1 is kept for what it adds beyond that — a confirmed day LATER than
// NextPeriodStart, the only shape that can catch a layer above the resolver
// clamping the named day back to the projected start.
//
// That the seed's own projection is the one the MODEL arrives at is anchored
// once per half, each half on the surface it reads: the JSON half compares
// next_period_start in the payload it already fetches
// (TestStatsOverviewConfirmsALateShiftOnOrAfterTheProjectedNextPeriodStart), the
// rendered half compares the dashboard's next-period slot in the very document
// it takes the ovulation slot from — where the model's start is the projected
// one today has already gone by, which is what this cohort's lateness looks
// like on that surface. Every other date on either
// side is derived from the same today, so an anchor held by one half only would
// leave the other blind to a drifting cohort.
//
// Returns the day the detector confirms and the projected next-period start it
// is measured against.
