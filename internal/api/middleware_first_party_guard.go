// requireFirstPartyRequest guards a GET route that consumes something
// one-time — a reveal mark, a pickup nonce — and therefore mutates state on a
// method the CSRF middleware never validates, because a safe method is not
// supposed to mutate anything. It asks whether the request is FIRST-PARTY, not
// whether it is a navigation: a client following the published next_path fetches,
// and refusing it would narrow the API for nothing (see the destination rule
// below). Moving the mutation to POST is the answer the
// method contract wants, but both such routes are the landing pages of a
// redirect-after-POST whose shape is published in docs/openapi.yaml (the
// register 303 and the calendar-feed `next_path`), so that is a spec change and
// not a handler change. Until it happens this is the CSRF equivalent the
// "Endpoint defense-in-depth" invariant asks for.
//
// What it actually closes is the SameSite=Lax residual. Every cookie these two
// routes read is Lax, so a cross-site subresource load — <img>, <iframe>, fetch,
// prefetch — already arrives with no cookies and consumes nothing. The one case
// Lax permits is a cross-site TOP-LEVEL navigation, which carries the cookies in
// full; that is the request this guard refuses, and Sec-Fetch-Site names it
// exactly.
//
// SAME-ORIGIN requests are judged by destination, not by whether they are a
// navigation. Both routes are the published `next_path` a JSON client is told to
// follow (docs/openapi.yaml), so a first-party client fetching one must not be
// turned away; `empty` is the destination such a fetch carries. Refusing it
// bought less than it looked: injected same-origin script that wanted the value
// would open the route in a window and read it out of the same-origin document,
// which wears `document` and passes. What is worth refusing is the destination no
// client of these routes ever has — `image`, `iframe`, `object` and their
// siblings — because those are the shapes that spend a one-time value with
// nothing rendered for anybody to notice.
//
// The guard is deliberately MONOTONE, and the rule is applied PER HEADER: each
// check refuses only on a value the browser actually stated, and an absent header
// decides nothing. A browser older than Chrome 76 / Firefox 90 / Safari 16.4, or
// a non-browser client carrying no ambient cookies to forge with, sends none of
// the family and lands exactly where it landed before this guard existed — on Lax
// plus the one-time CAS and the sealed owner-bound cookie. A proxy that forwards
// part of the family and strips the rest is the same case one header at a time,
// which is why no check may read an absent header as a refusal: doing so would
// trade a residual for an owner who can no longer pick up her recovery code at
// all, the worse failure on a self-hosted instance. The absence is never
// attacker-controlled either — page script cannot strip a `Sec-` header from a
// victim's browser, so what an attacker's request states is what it is judged on.
//
// `refuse` is the guarded route's OWN neutral exit rather than a new error
// surface, so a refused request is indistinguishable from the replay each route
// already answers, and stays audited in that route's existing vocabulary. It
// receives the reason the check that fired states, because only the guard knows
// which one did.
