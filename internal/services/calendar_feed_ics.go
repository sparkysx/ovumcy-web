// Calendar (.ics) feed builder (issue #126-replacement / .ics, slice 3). This
// file is the PURE, transport-free RFC 5545 builder: given an owner, their day
// logs, an injected now/location, and the localized medical-safety disclaimer,
// it renders a read-only text/calendar body of the owner's estimated period and
// ovulation days: the projections plus the current cycle's temperature-confirmed
// ovulation day. It performs NO transport, NO auth, and NO persistence — the api layer
// owns token resolution, headers, and rate-limiting.
//
// Medical-safety invariant (same as the webhook reminder decision): it reuses
// the EXACT prediction path the dashboard uses (BuildCycleStatsFromLogs →
// DashboardUpcomingPredictions, gated by PredictionsSuppressed and shaped by
// ResolveProjectionRanges). It NEVER fabricates a date the app itself refuses
// to show — where the dashboard shows a window, the feed carries that window —
// and when in-app predictions are suppressed (unpredictable cycle, a pregnancy
// pause, a cycle running past its reference length by more than a week, or
// irregular-cycle mode with fewer than three completed cycles), it emits ZERO
// prediction events, so neither a
// "fertile window" is pushed into a pregnant owner's calendar nor three cycles
// of invented period dates into a calendar client the app itself would not name
// a single date to.
//
// The feed carries estimated dates, and one of them is not a projection: the
// current cycle's ovulation day as the owner's own temperatures confirm it
// (ConfirmedCurrentCycleOvulation). It is published exactly when the dashboard,
// the calendar grid and the JSON API name it — that resolver's gate
// (ConfirmedOvulationWithheld) is the only one it passes, so it outlives the
// overdue signal and stays withheld in unpredictable-cycle mode, during a
// pregnancy pause and before the first completed cycle. It is the one event the
// feed publishes for a day already behind the owner; past cycles are never
// carried.
//
// Data-minimization invariant: every VEVENT SUMMARY is the SAME neutral,
// contentless title (calendarFeedNeutralSummary) — no cycle phase, no date, no
// symptom appears in the SUMMARY, so a lock-screen preview or a shared calendar
// reveals nothing about the owner's health. The concrete date lives only in the
// DTSTART/DTEND all-day fields a calendar client needs to place the event; the
// disclaimer lives in the DESCRIPTION. (A detailed-event opt-in is a later
// slice; the default here is always neutral.)

//     the dashboard, the calendar grid and the JSON API read.
//   - If in-app predictions are suppressed (DashboardPredictionDisabled — the
//     owner's unpredictable-cycle mode — stats.PregnancyPaused, or
//     DashboardCycleOverdue), emit ZERO prediction events. This is the hard
//     medical-safety suppression gate.
//   - Otherwise project the next calendarFeedProjectionCycles cycles forward from
//     the owner's last period start, reusing the dashboard's own cycle-start
//     projection + window helpers, and emit a predicted-next-period event and an
