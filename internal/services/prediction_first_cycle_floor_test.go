// The completed-cycle floor is one policy with five consumers: the calendar
// grid, the .ics feed, the webhook reminder pass, the dashboard reminder banner
// and the implantation-bleeding hint offered when a new cycle start is logged.
// Until the first cycle closes, the fertile window and the ovulation date are
// the onboarding cycle-length slider projected forward, and with one or two
// completed cycles they rest on a single observed length or a pair, so every
// consumer must withhold the fertility half of the projection until three
// cycles are behind the owner — two of the five carry it off the instance. The
// same table drives a three-completed-cycle history as the positive anchor: the
// surfaces must resume there, or a guard that simply emptied every projection
// would read as green.

// implantationHintAgeDays ages the shared history so that the day being logged
// sits inside the closing cycle's implantation window. See
// assertImplantationHint.

// assertImplantationHint is the fifth consumer. Logging a cycle start a week or
