The shipped compose files (the root one and the five example stacks) no longer repeat the binary's
in-code defaults (`${KEY:-20}`); they forward `${KEY:-}`, which the binary reads as unset, so a
default lives in one place. The compose passthrough test now also judges the root compose file and
fails on an environment entry written at another indentation instead of ending the block silently.
No runtime behavior change.
