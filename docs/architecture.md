# Architecture &amp; trust model

Ovumcy is a privacy-critical, self-hosted menstrual/fertility tracker that holds
special-category health data. It ships as a **single Go binary** (templates,
locales and static assets embedded via `go:embed`) and is **owner-role-only**:
one instance may host several independent owners (household self-hosting), each
the sole owner of its own data, isolated by `user_id`. There is no viewer or
partner role.

This document complements the deployment topology in the
[README](../README.md#architecture): it shows the **internal layering**, the
**trust boundaries**, and the **lifecycle of a state-mutating request**. The
security controls named here are the test-backed invariants in
[`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) and their public mirror
[`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md) — this file is a map, not
the source of truth.

## Layered architecture

Strict one-directional layering. Transport never reaches the database; domain
logic never depends on HTTP; persisted types stay transport-free. All three are
checked mechanically against the whole tree by `scripts/archcheck`, which CI
runs on every change; test files are outside the check, because a fixture
legitimately reaches across a layer boundary to prove the layer below it.

- **`internal/api` (transport only).** Request parsing, content negotiation
  (HTML / HTMX partial / JSON), authentication, role and CSRF enforcement, error
  mapping. It never touches the database directly and holds no business logic.
- **`internal/services` (domain logic).** Cycle prediction, stats, dashboard and
  calendar views, settings, export, onboarding. It never imports Fiber or HTTP
  status codes; it returns domain data and sentinel errors.
- **`internal/db` (persistence).** Repositories and forward-only SQL migrations.
  Every per-user query is scoped by `user_id`.
- **`internal/models` (transport-free types).** Shared domain types with no
  serialization or HTTP concerns; `/api/v1/*` DTOs are separate api-layer types.
- **Cross-cutting** (`internal/security`, `i18n`, `templates`, `httpx`,
  `bootstrap`): AEAD sealing and token logic, localization, HTMX status-markup
  wrappers, and one dependency-wiring recipe shared by production and tests.
- **`internal/reminders` (background scheduler).** The one caller that reaches the
  domain layer with neither a request nor an operator behind it: a lifecycle-tied
  trigger, started from `cmd/ovumcy` when the off-by-default
  `REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` is on, that decides *when* to run the daily webhook
  notify pass. The pass itself — listing owners, deciding due reminders,
  delivering, and writing each per-reminder watermark — stays in
  `internal/services`, and the outbound POST it makes is the only call the app
  places that no one asked it for; everything else it dials (OIDC discovery, JWKS,
  token exchange) happens inside a request it is answering. Because the pass runs
  outside a request it has no session and no CSRF token: its owner scoping comes
  from the same per-`user_id` repository calls the request path uses.
- **`internal/cli` (operator commands).** The second entry point of the binary
  (`ovumcy users`, `reset-password`, `notify`, `webhook`, `healthcheck`,
  `repair`). It is not transport and does not pass through the authorization
  boundary below — it reaches `internal/services` and `internal/db` directly, and
  is gated by shell or container access to the host instead. All of them but
  `repair` open the database the way the server does, migrations included;
  `repair` is the one that must reach a database a migration is refusing, so it
  opens without applying any and is the only entry point that does. Operator use
  is documented in
  the [README](../README.md#architecture) and
  [`docs/self-hosted.md`](self-hosted.md).

`internal/apideps` (the dependency-wiring struct and ports shared by the server
and the CLI) and `internal/testdb` (a PostgreSQL test harness) are wiring rather
than layers and are deliberately left off this map.

## Trust boundaries

The security-relevant view. Everything left of the authorization boundary is
untrusted; every read of per-user data on the right is scoped to the
authenticated session's `user_id`.

```

Load-bearing invariants (see [`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md)):

- **Privacy boundary.** No account, surface, or export may expose another
  account's data. A resource id from the request is always combined with the
  session `user_id`, never trusted alone.
- **Endpoint defense-in-depth.** Every state-mutating `/api/v1/*` endpoint is
  CSRF-protected — the pre-session ones (register, login, password reset)
  included, since the CSRF middleware is mounted globally, ahead of routing, and
  does not care whether a session exists. Every such endpoint that sits behind
  `AuthRequired` **additionally** declares `OwnerOnly`; the endpoints that run
  before any session exists have no role to enforce, and that exclusion set —
  which applies to `OwnerOnly` alone, never to CSRF — is named in full in
  [`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md) rather than restated
  here. The single CSRF **validation** exemption is the OIDC callback — `POST
  /auth/oidc/callback`, plus `GET` on the same path under
  `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`, a safe method the middleware never validates —
  protected by the sealed one-time state cookie. The calendar client's own
  path in the diagram above bypasses the CSRF box entirely rather than passing
  through it unvalidated: its GET is excluded (see `api.IsCalendarFeedRequest`)
  from the same middleware's safe-method side effect (minting and setting its
  own cookie), which is not a validation exemption and does not widen the one
  named here — detail in [`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md)'s
  *Calendar feed subscription* and *CSRF and CORS* sections.
- **No usable secret in transport.** Passwords, auth/recovery/reset tokens and
  stored secrets never appear in URLs, JSON, HTML or logs. The exception ledger is
  [`docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`](SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md)'s, not this file's:
  the read-only calendar-feed capability token (hashed at rest,
  one-click-revocable, 404-no-oracle, rate-limited, log-redacted) is the one
  exception for a value usable on its own; the TOTP enrollment seed rendered
  into the enrollment page's HTML is the second, narrower declared exception
  (minted fresh per visit, inert until the first code verifies); and the
  one-time HTML reveals — the recovery code and the feed subscribe URL — are
  sanctioned shown-once displays, consumed server-side and never re-rendered.
- **Session invalidation.** Any credential or security-posture change bumps
  `AuthSessionVersion` in the same atomic update, so stale sessions stop working.
- **Sealed cookies.** All auth/recovery/reset/flash cookies are AEAD-sealed
  values, never plaintext or base64(JSON).
- **Medical safety.** Every ovulation and next-period surface carries an estimate
  qualifier plus a persistent "not medical advice or a method of contraception"
  disclaimer.
- **Re-auth for erasure.** Clear-data and delete-account require fresh
  re-authentication on top of session + role + CSRF: the current local
  password, or — only for an account that has no local password — a fresh
  purpose-bound OIDC step-up. The check never downgrades for an account that
  has a password.

## Lifecycle of a state-mutating request

How a write (e.g. `PUT /api/v1/days/:date`) crosses the boundary. Controls run in
order; any failure short-circuits before domain logic.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as Browser
    participant MW as api middleware
    participant H as Handler
    participant S as Service
    participant R as Repository
    participant DB as SQLite / Postgres

    B->>MW: POST/PUT /api/v1/... (CSRF token + session cookie)
    MW->>MW: security headers · per-IP rate limit · body limit
    MW->>MW: CSRF Origin check
    MW->>MW: AuthRequired — open sealed cookie, verify AuthSessionVersion
    MW->>H: OwnerOnly
    H->>S: domain call(ctx, session user_id, validated input)
    S->>R: query scoped WHERE user_id = ?
    R->>DB: read / write (dates canonicalized to UTC-midnight)
    DB-->>S: rows
    S-->>H: domain result / sentinel error
    H-->>B: HTMX / JSON / HTML (no secrets, per-day fields sanitized)
```

## Data isolation &amp; storage

- **One engine per deployment.** SQLite is the baseline default; PostgreSQL is
  the advanced option (`DB_DRIVER=postgres` + `DATABASE_URL`). Both are covered by
  boot, migrations and tests. There is no automatic SQLite→Postgres migration.
- **Owner isolation is enforced at the repository layer**, not just in handlers:
  repository methods take `user_id` as an explicit parameter and every per-user
  query pins `WHERE user_id = ?`. Cross-owner access is a tested denial
  (`symptoms_idor_regression_test.go`); the legacy non-owner role is rejected
  separately.
- **Rate-limit and attempt-limiter state is in-memory and process-local**, valid
  only under the single-instance contract — horizontal scaling would need an
  external shared store.

## Deployment topology

The runtime and deployment paths (baseline single instance, the preferred
reverse-proxy stack, backups, and secrets) are documented in the
[README](../README.md#architecture) and [`docs/self-hosted.md`](self-hosted.md).
The pushed image is a shell-free `FROM scratch` runtime built from the repo-root
`Dockerfile`; every published image is Cosign-signed and carries a SLSA
build-provenance attestation and an SBOM. Publication waits for the commit's own
CI run and scans the exact image before pushing it, so a tag or `:latest` never
reaches the registry ahead of the checks for the commit it was built from.
