// Command changelogd keeps changelog entries out of CHANGELOG.md until a
// release is cut. Every pull request adds one fragment file under changelog.d/
// instead of editing the "## [Unreleased]" section, which is the only spot in
// the tree several branches reliably contend for: two pull requests inserting
// an entry at the same anchor conflict in the merge queue, and rebasing replays
// the earlier commit straight back into the contested spot.
//
// Two subcommands:
//
//	changelogd check
//	    CI gate for pull requests. Env BASE_REF (default origin/main) names the
//	    base to diff against. Passes when the branch adds exactly one fragment
//	    under changelog.d/, named changelog.d/<slug>.md, the slug
//	    being the branch (GITHUB_HEAD_REF in CI, else the current branch)
//	    without its type/ prefix — setting GITHUB_HEAD_REF locally overrides the
//	    current branch, e.g. to check a detached worktree against the name its
//	    pull request will carry — or when it edits CHANGELOG.md itself in a way only
//	    release assembly does (adding the "## [x.y.z]" heading of a new release,
//	    not re-typing an existing one); every added or modified
//	    fragment must be valid. Independently of either, a CHANGELOG.md edit
//	    that is neither assembly nor confined to an already-released section
//	    fails. Exit 0 when the gate passes, 1 when it fails.
//
//	changelogd assemble -version X.Y.Z [-date YYYY-MM-DD]
//	    Run by hand at release time. Folds every accumulated fragment, plus
//	    whatever is still frozen under "## [Unreleased]", into a new released
//	    section and deletes the consumed fragments.
//
// Exit codes follow scripts/patchcov: 0 pass, 1 the gate itself failing, 2 for
// tool breakage (git unavailable, unreadable files, bad flags).
