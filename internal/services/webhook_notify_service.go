// Webhook notify pass (issue #124, slice 3). This is the request-free
// orchestration that ties the slices together: it lists every owner, decrypts
// each owner's webhook URL, asks the pure decision layer (slice 2) which
// reminders are due, delivers them through the hardened egress client, and — ON
// SUCCESS ONLY — advances the per-kind watermark so the same reminder is never
// sent twice.
//
// Cross-owner isolation: every step is scoped to a single owner's record — the
// URL decrypted with that owner's aad, the decision built from that owner's user
// + logs, the delivery aimed at that owner's URL, the watermark written to that
// owner's row. One owner's health data is therefore never carried into a request
// aimed at another owner.
//
// Idempotency: the watermark is CLAIMED before the POST and released when the
// POST fails. A pass takes the claim by compare-and-set on the same watermark
// column the decision reads, so at most one pass can own a given (owner, kind,
// cycle anchor); a failed POST hands the claim back, leaving the watermark where
// the pass found it, so the next pass (a same-day re-run or a concurrent
// operator cron) still retries it, and a succeeded POST leaves the claim
// standing, so a re-run skips it.
//
// Claiming BEFORE delivery rather than writing after it is what makes the pass
// safe against OVERLAP. The due-set is computed from the record snapshot taken by
// ListAllForNotify, so two passes that both list before either writes — the
// scheduler goroutine and an operator `ovumcy notify` process, which is a
// separate OS process and therefore beyond any in-process lock — each see an
// uncovered anchor and each decide the reminder is due. With the write deferred
// to after Deliver, both delivered. The claim is the coordination point with
// slice-1's watermark columns; it is the only mutual exclusion the pass has.
//
// The claim carries a second job the watermark cannot do: REVOCATION. The
// snapshot is minutes old by the time a POST leaves, and in that window the
// owner can disable delivery, replace or remove the endpoint, narrow the shared
// reminder lead window, or clear their data — none of which moves a watermark (a
// settings save deliberately leaves them alone) and one of which, clear-data,
// NULLs them and so re-opens the first-ever-claim branch. Each of those writes
// advances the owner's webhook_config_version in the same statement, and the
// claim pins the epoch its own snapshot carried, so a revoked configuration can
// no longer win a claim. The line this holds is "no NEW request begins under a
// revoked configuration"; a request already on the wire when the revocation
// lands cannot be recalled, which is documented for operators rather than
// papered over here.
//
// The cost, stated plainly: claiming first turns a returned delivery error into a
// retry but a HARD KILL between claim and release into a permanent skip. A pass
// that dies mid-POST — host reboot, OOM kill, container eviction, an interrupted
// `ovumcy notify` — leaves the claim standing with nothing delivered, and no
// counter records it (the process that would have counted it is gone). That is
// at-most-once for this window, deliberately: a missed reminder is a convenience
// lost, a duplicate reminder about health data at an owner's endpoint is not.
// Narrowing it further needs a claim that is distinguishable from a completed
// send, which the single date column cannot express — a schema decision, not a
// change to make here. Stated for operators in docs/notifications.md.
//
// No-secret discipline: the pass logs counts and at most owner ids — never the
// URL, token, decrypted health specifics, or payload.

// It lists the per-owner notify projection and advances a per-kind watermark.
