// that run reports all three `success` whether its lanes executed or ci.yml's
// `changes` job cleared them for a tree the queued pull request had already
// tested (the proven-tree skip). Observed on 285d14c0: queue run 100349007410
// green with test-go-shard, test-go-rest and every race lane skipped, the work
// done once in PR 962's own run. A release commit could thus be tagged with no
// Go or race job executed in any run the gate read. `WORK_CHECKS` names a real
// job per lane, and the gate takes its `success` only from a run of ci.yml that
// the merge queue or a push to `main` started — never from a pull request run,
// which executes the pull request branch's own copy of the workflow; these tests
// hold the gate to it, over the real script.

// extraSuite is a further run on the commit, and otherWorkflowFile a workflow
// that declares the same job names ci.yml does. Neither is anything ci.yml's
