// A catalogue value handed to fmt.Sprintf is a contract between six JSON files
// and a Go argument list, and until this barrier nothing in the build read both
// ends of it. Key parity compares key SETS and never looks at a value; the
// template barrier reads values only for emptiness; `go vet`'s printf checker
// stops at the first non-constant format string, which is every one of these
// sites by construction. So a translator who writes %s where the code passes an
// int ships `%!s(int=12)` into the Insights summary, and one verb too few ships
// `%!(EXTRA string=days)` — on the page whose whole purpose is to state what
// the data supports.
//
// The barrier checks the verb SEQUENCE, not the verb count. A count-only check
// is satisfied by a locale that swapped %d and %s while keeping six of them,
// which is the drift that renders wrong rather than the drift that renders
// short. It checks all SIX catalogues, because a rule enforced in the reference
// file alone is a rule enforced in one language out of six. And it checks the
// English fallback literal beside each call site, because that literal is a
// second copy of the same format: the catalogue and the fallback have to stay
// in step with each other AND with the argument list, and only one of the three
// is visible from any single file.
//
// It does not duplicate TestPluralVariantPatternsKeepPrintfVerbs (plural_test.go),
// and that test is not a smaller version of this one. That barrier compares the
// number of "%d" occurrences among the CLDR variants of one plural family
// against each other, and never against a Go call site; it is count-based,
// "%d"-only, and has no opinion about a key no plural family contains. Every
// key below is outside its reach.
//
// What it does NOT see, stated so no reader concludes the broader claim: it is
// syntactic, so it cannot tell which of several literals a branch actually
// reaches at run time, and it cannot read the Go TYPE of an argument expression
// without a type checker. The type column below is declared, not inferred — but
// it is not free-floating: the argument COUNT at each site is read from the
// AST, the verb sequence is checked against the declared types by
// verbAcceptsGoType, and every catalogue value and every fallback is actually
// run through fmt.Sprintf with arguments built from that column, so a declared
// type that disagrees with its verb cannot stay green.
//
// The key reader follows a variable ONE hop — a local assignment, or a package
// constant — and no further. A key that reaches its lookup through anything
// deeper leaves the site with no key of its own, and a site with no key must
// declare a keyOrigin naming where its key is written. So the failure mode of
// the reader's shallowness is a table entry, not a silent gap.

// localizedFormatContract is one `fmt.Sprintf` site whose pattern comes from
// the locale catalogue.
//
// Sites are matched to entries by (file, function), and within that bucket by
// the KEY each site names — not by table order. Order pairing was the first
// draft and it is a trap: swapping two entries mispairs them, and where their
// argument counts happen to agree it fails silently and the arity check then
// verifies nothing. A bucket holding one site needs no matching at all.
//
// A sixth summary added to a function that already holds five fails until it is
// declared here. That is the point of the table: the recurring cost this
// barrier exists against is the NEXT summary string, not the ones below.
