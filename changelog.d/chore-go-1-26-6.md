### Security

- **Go toolchain bumped to 1.27.1.** The module's `go` line (`go.mod`) and the runtime image's
  builder stage (`golang:1.27.1-alpine3.24` in the `Dockerfile`) both move to it, which clears the
  standard-library advisories govulncheck reported as reachable from this code on 1.26.5: quadratic
  complexity in `net/url` `resolvePath` (GO-2026-6218), JavaScript regexp context tracking in
  `html/template` (GO-2026-6091), unbounded post-handshake messages in `crypto/tls`
  (GO-2026-6090), missing recursion-depth guards in `encoding/xml` (GO-2026-6088) and
  `encoding/asn1` (GO-2026-5972), and ASCII-only Punycode labels in `golang.org/x/net/idna`
  (GO-2026-5026). Four of the six are reached only through outbound paths an operator configures —
  webhook delivery and the OIDC CA file. The final runtime stage is unchanged.
