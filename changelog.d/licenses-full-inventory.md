### Internal

- **`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` now delivers the completeness its scope sentence promises.** The
  file claimed to list the third-party software redistributed in the built application while
  inventorying only htmx and dismissing Tailwind as "not redistributed" — the shipped
  `tailwind.css` is git-tracked, embedded via `go:embed` and served with Tailwind's MIT banner
  preserved on line 1, and ~45 Go packages under MIT/BSD-3-Clause/Apache-2.0 notice obligations
  were statically linked into the released binary with no attribution anywhere. The file now
  carries a generated Go-module table (one row per license-bearing directory of the binary's
  build graph, named by the deepest common ancestor of the packages sharing that license file:
  package, license, link to the pinned version's license text), produced by the new
  `scripts/licensesdoc` from a `go-licenses` report and verified by a new `test-go-analysis` CI
  step that regenerates the report and refuses a stale committed block — so a dependency bump
  cannot silently un-true the inventory again. The Tailwind entry now states the compiled file
  IS shipped and that its preserved `/*! tailwindcss … MIT License */` banner is the notice, and
  a runtime-image section attributes what the scratch image copies in: the Mozilla CA
  certificate bundle (MPL-2.0), the IANA tz database (public domain), and the two account files
  built on `alpine-baselayout` (GPL-2.0-only) bases. A refuse-by-default override table
  hand-corrects the rows `go-licenses` gets wrong — `modernc.org/mathutil` (unclassifiable
  standard BSD-3-Clause text), `modernc.org/libc` (misreported as MIT via a notices file) and
  `modernc.org/memory` (linked to the Go project's LICENSE-GO instead of the module's own
  grant) — with each override pinned twice, to the exact reported row and to the version go.mod
  requires (the second pin is what makes a bump loud even for a row reported as
  version-free `Unknown`); the generator also refuses any Unknown or non-https license link
  rather than committing a dead or machine-local one. The report is taken over the shipped
  binary's build graph (`GOOS=linux`, `CGO_ENABLED=0`, the Dockerfile's build environment) —
  the graph is GOOS-dependent, so an unpinned host graph differs by a row. An inventory-only
  edit forces the Go lanes on, so a hand edit cannot dodge the gate. No behaviour changes.
