/**
 * The dashboard's calm cycle-start SUGGESTION — the `[data-cycle-start-suggestion]`
 * hint inside `#dashboard-cycle-start` — as opposed to the inline cycle-start
 * QUESTION beside the period toggle, which `dashboard_journal_regressions_test.go`
 * and the day-editor specs already cover.
 *
 * Reaching it is not just "a period day after a long gap". The dashboard renders
 * the hint under `ShowCycleStartSuggestion && !ShowCycleStartQuestion`
 * (`dashboard.html`), and both flags share one core in
 * `internal/services/cycle_start_policy.go`:
 *
 *   ShowCycleStartSuggestion = today is a period day, is not already a cycle
 *                              start, and sits >= 15 days (manualCycleStart
 *                              SuggestionGapDays) past the latest anchor —
 *                              latest explicit `cycle_start` log, else the
 *                              account's last-period-start.
 *   ShowCycleStartQuestion   = the same core AND no competing cycle start
 *                              inside today's period cluster.
 *
 * So the suggestion state is exactly the core plus a competing cycle start in
 * the cluster: bleeding that already carries this cycle's recorded start.
 * `ShouldAskCycleStartQuestion`'s own comment names why the inline one-tap
 * question steps aside there — answering yes would have to REPLACE that start,
 * which belongs to the manual control's confirmation flow — and the calm hint
 * is what points at that control.
 *
 * Seeded state (offsets from the server's today, read off the dashboard):
 *
 *   -40  onboarding start, so the account's last-period-start cannot become the
 *        anchor (the default onboarding of today-3 would make the gap 3 and no
 *        hint would render at all)
 *   -16  explicit cycle start -> the anchor, gap 16 >= 15, the FIRST day of the
 *        period cluster below, and the competing start inside it
 *   -12, -8, -4, today  period days at <= 5-day steps, which is what keeps them
 *        in ONE period cluster: `buildPeriodClusters` splits only on a gap of
 *        5+ empty days, so -16..today stays a single cluster and -16's start
 *        competes with today
 *
 * Auto-period-fill (on by default from onboarding) widens each written day
 * forward by up to the period length and never writes a cycle start, so it can
 * only reinforce that single cluster, never split it or move the anchor.
 *
 * Why the competing start sits on the cluster's FIRST day: that position is the
 * one the flow used to lose, so it is where the browser lane is worth spending.
 * `findCompetingCycleStart` rebuilds each candidate at location midnight while
 * the cluster bounds come from `dateOnly` (UTC midnight); those are different
 * instants under a non-zero UTC offset, so a start on the cluster's first day
 * read as sitting *before* the cluster ahead of UTC — no conflict reported, and
 * the confirmed replacement left it in place. `withinPeriodCluster`
 * (`internal/services/cycle_start_policy.go`) now re-anchors the compared day to
 * the bounds' own UTC midnight, and the offset-parameterized guarantee lives in
 * the service regression (`cycle_start_policy_boundary_test.go`), which pins
 * both cluster edges against a UTC+1 and a UTC-5 location.
 *
 * This spec runs in whatever timezone the runner's browser reports (pinned by
 * `registerAndOnboardWithStartDaysAgo`), so what it adds over that regression is the
 * end-to-end path across the first-day position — the hint, the replace
 * confirmation, and the clearing pass that must remove that start once the owner
 * accepts. On a UTC runner (CI) the two midnights coincide and the position is
 * no harder than any other; on a machine ahead of UTC — Europe/Belgrade, where
 * this seed was run — it is precisely the day the old comparison dropped.
 *
 * Seeding goes through the API with an explicit `Origin` (the CSRF middleware
 * validates it and `page.request.*` sends none of its own) rather than through
 * the dashboard's save button: the button is being removed with the autosave
 * work, and this spec's subject is the hint, not the save control.
