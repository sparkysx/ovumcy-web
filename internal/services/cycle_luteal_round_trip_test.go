// The round-trip invariant pinned here: an ovulation OBSERVED on cycle day N
// must train a luteal-phase parameter that predicts cycle day N again on an
// identical next cycle. Inference (InferUserLutealPhase) and prediction
// (CalcOvulationDay) are the two directions of one arithmetic, and nothing but
// a test crosses them — each is self-consistent alone, so a disagreement about
// whether the ovulation day itself belongs to the luteal phase is invisible
// from either side.
//
// It was not invisible to owners. Reading the parameter as the calendar span
// from the ovulation date to the next period start counts the ovulation day
// twice, making the value one day too large; CalcOvulationDay then subtracts it
// from the cycle length and lands one day early. An ovulation observed on cycle
// day 15 predicted cycle day 14 — moving the ovulation date and both edges of
// the fertile window a day earlier on the dashboard, the calendar, /api/v1, the
// webhook reminders and the .ics feed, for exactly the owners who had logged
// enough BBT or cervical-mucus signal to earn a personalized model.

// inference must read its ovulation on cycle day ovulationCycleDays[i].
//
// The BBT layout is dictated by the detector: six flat readings open the cycle
// as the coverline window, then three consecutive elevated days start the day
// AFTER ovulation, because the thermal shift follows ovulation. That needs
// ovulationCycleDay >= 6 and ovulationCycleDay+3 <= cycleLength. The egg-white
// layout is the peak-day rule read backwards: ovulation is peak + 1, so the peak
// sits on the day before, which needs ovulationCycleDay >= 2.
//
// Those bounds are checked rather than merely documented. A case built outside
// them yields no detectable shift, and InferUserLutealPhase then declines to
// refine — a failure that reads as a defect in the production inference instead
// of as a fixture built outside its own range.
