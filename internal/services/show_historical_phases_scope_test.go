// ShowHistoricalPhases is a display preference with a stated scope, and the
// scope is narrower than its name suggests. Its settings copy promises to
// "paint ovulation, fertility peak, and pre-fertile markers on past completed
// cycles in the calendar" — drawn markers, on the calendar and on the stats
// cycle stack that shares the calendar's encoding.
//
// The stats prose that groups moods and symptoms by inferred phase does not
// ride it. Those surfaces derive their phases from CalcOvulationDay for their
// own gate — owner, plus the completed-cycle pattern minimum — and never read
// the preference, so an owner who turns the markers off still reads
// phase-grouped statistics.
//
// That asymmetry is deliberate, and until now nothing said so: an audit reading
// the preference's name would take the prose surfaces for a gap. Widening it to
// them would be a behaviour change beyond what the toggle promises, removing
// insights the owner never asked to hide. So the scope is pinned instead, in
// both directions — the surfaces it governs, and the surfaces it does not.
