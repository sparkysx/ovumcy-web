// currentPathQueryAllowlist is the closed set of query parameters a page may
// echo back into its own rendered address, each paired with the shape its own
// consumer accepts. It holds exactly the parameters the page handlers read: the
// calendar anchors, the onboarding step and the privacy back-link. Anything
// else is dropped whatever its value, because the rendered address reaches the
// markup of every page and, through the footer privacy link, a new outgoing URL
// — so an attacker-supplied `email` or `error` in a crafted link would land in
// browser history, the Referer header and the server access log.
//
// The names are only half the filter. An allowlist over names alone lets any
// value through under an allowed key, which is the very same leak wearing a
// different key: `?step=victim@example.com` renders exactly like `?email=`
// would. So a retained value must also match what its consumer accepts, and a
// parameter whose value does not match is dropped rather than trimmed — the
// same fail-closed direction the rest of this function takes.
// `back` is deliberately NOT a member: its policy is not a predicate over a
// value but a rewrite of it (fragment stripped, own query filtered, path
// re-checked), so it is allowlisted by its own branch in
// sanitizeCurrentPathQuery and decided by SanitizeBackNavigationValue. Holding
// a nil entry for it here instead made this map claim to answer a question it
// cannot, and left an unreachable nil check standing at the point of use.
