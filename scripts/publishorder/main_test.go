// Package publishorder holds the publish job to the one ordering that makes
// its promises true: no public tag exists until the digest under it has been
// signed, attested, and read back.
//
// The `publish` job in .github/workflows/docker-image.yml used to push with
// `tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}`, which creates `vX.Y.Z`, `latest`,
// `main` and `sha-…` at the moment of the push, and only then installed Cosign,
// signed, and attested. Between them sat a check that the image pulls
// anonymously — a step that confirms the unsigned release is reachable by
// anyone. A failure in Cosign or in the attestation therefore turned the
// workflow red with the release already published, unsigned and without
// provenance. README.md tells operators the opposite in as many words: every
// published image is Cosign-signed, carries a SLSA provenance attestation, and
// ships an SBOM. A red workflow retracts nothing; nothing deletes a tag that
// already resolves.
//
// So the job pushes by DIGEST with no tag at all, signs and attests that
// digest, verifies both against the registry, and only then writes the tags —
// from the manifest bytes that already hash to the signed digest, which is what
// makes the promotion incapable of pointing a tag anywhere else.
//
// What is guarded here, each because the others alone read green over the
// defect. Deliberately not opened with a count: the list has grown four times
// and a number in front of it is one more claim to keep true.
//
//   - the ORDER, statically, and with it the STEP LIST that runs before the
//     promotion. Searching earlier steps for `steps.meta.outputs.tags` catches
//     a step that reads the derived list and misses one that spells a tag out;
//     nothing can enumerate every way a step might write a tag, so the window
//     is closed from the other end instead — a step that appears in it and is
//     not on the reviewed list fails, whatever it does;
//   - what the three steps between the push and the promotion ACT ON. The
//     order rule reads their names, and a name is all it reads: a signing step
//     emptied to `echo ok` keeps its place in the sequence and its position
//     proves nothing;
//   - the PROMOTION and the VERIFICATION, by running their real scripts over a
//     stubbed registry. A guard that only read the order would pass over a
//     promotion that writes a tag it never checked, or a verification that
//     accepts an alias resolving to a digest nobody signed;
//   - the DOCKER HUB MIRROR, at both ends. The tail of the job is pinned the
//     way the window before the promotion is, so nothing reaches a second
//     registry until the first one's release is complete; and the copy and
//     its check run over that same stub, because a mirror that resolved a tag
//     rather than the signed digest, or one whose signature never travelled
//     with it, is a tag on a public registry that no operator can verify;
//   - the TOKEN PARSE, against a real interpreter rather than that stub, which
//     shadows it everywhere else. It is the only place the line both registry
//     steps pull the bearer token out of the registry's answer with is
//     executed at all, and it holds the two steps to one spelling of it;
//   - the IDENTITY PATTERN the signature is checked against, by running the
//     verify step with `cosign` and `gh` shadowed. The repository is spliced
//     into a regular expression there, and a dot left unescaped in it matches
//     any character — in the one field that check exists to pin;
//   - the IMAGE NAME every later step reads, by running the step that derives
//     it. The fixtures below hand `IMAGE_NAME` and `IMAGE_PATH` in as values,
//     which is what makes them fixtures — and what would otherwise leave the
//     line computing them the one `run:` block in the job nothing executes;
//   - the READER this file reaches all of that through. `envConstants` takes a
//     constant off the workflow rather than restating it, and a step block
//     begins straight after the line naming the step — so a step whose first
//     key is `env:` has no newline in front of it to match on.
//
// What is NOT provable here is the end-to-end negative — breaking Cosign on a
// real tag push and observing that no public alias appears. That needs a
// registry and a release tag; the order rule below is what stands in for it in
// CI, and it is the property that experiment would be testing.
