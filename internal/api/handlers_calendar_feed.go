// Calendar (.ics) feed endpoint (issue #126-replacement / .ics, slice 3).
//
// Route: GET /calendar/feed/:token.ics — a PAGE route (registerPageRoutes), NOT
// under /api/v1 and NOT behind AuthRequired/OwnerOnly: a calendar client sends
// no cookie, so the request is authenticated by the bearer TOKEN alone. The
// route is shaped so the token is a clean :token parameter (Fiber treats '.' as
// a parameter delimiter, so ":token.ics" binds param "token" with ".ics" as a
// literal constant suffix). This matters for log redaction: SafeRequestLogPath
// prefers the matched route template ("/calendar/feed/:token.ics"), whose last
// segment already begins with ':' and is therefore emitted verbatim as
// ":token.ics" — the token VALUE never reaches a log line. The raw-path
// fallback is additionally hardened in request_logging.go to mask an
// "<opaque-token>.ics" segment, closing the flagged gap even if the route
// template were ever unavailable.
//
// Security envelope (all enforced here + in CalendarFeedService):
//   - Token IS the authorization. CalendarFeedService.ResolveFeed splits it,
//     resolves the owner by non-secret selector, constant-time-verifies the
//     secret verifier, and scopes every read to the resolved user id.
//   - 404-no-oracle: a malformed token, unknown selector, wrong verifier, and
//     disabled feed ALL return an identical bare 404 and no Set-Cookie, and are
//     timing-equalized (a dummy bcrypt runs on the selector-miss path inside the
//     service). Bare here means what c.SendStatus actually sends: Fiber's fixed
//     status text under text/plain, the same bytes whatever the cause was — not
//     an empty body.
//   - Rate-limited per-IP by the edge /api-style limiter wired in main.go for
//     this exact path; a 429 returns the limiter's own response (no UI needed).
//   - Response headers pin text/calendar, a private 1-hour cache, and
//     X-Robots-Tag: noindex.

	// CalendarFeedRateLimitPrefix is the path prefix the composition root

// IsCalendarFeedRequest reports whether method and path together select
// fiber's dispatch of the cookieless feed's own route — GET or HEAD (app.Get
// registers both) at a concrete feed URL — as opposed to a neighbour that
// merely shares its leading characters, a nested or empty-token path under the
// same prefix, or a mutating verb. The two app-wide middlewares that skip this
// route (csrfMiddlewareConfig.Next in cmd/ovumcy/server.go, the early return
// in LanguageMiddleware) and the feed's own rate limiter (server.go) all key on
// this one predicate, so the three can never disagree about which requests are
// "the feed".
//
// path is compared against fiber's OWN routing normalization
// (httpx.RoutingNormalizedPath), not the raw wire path c.Path() returns: the
// shipped fiberConfig (cmd/ovumcy/server.go) leaves CaseSensitive and
// StrictRouting both off, so the router folds ASCII case and trailing slashes
// away before matching a route, and a predicate comparing the untouched path
// claims fewer spellings than the router actually dispatches here.
//
// The token/suffix boundary mirrors fiber's own left-to-right param scan
// (path.go's findParamLen: strings.Index, never strings.LastIndex) rather than
// a HasSuffix(".ics")-and-slice reading of the same string: fiber finds the
// FIRST ".ics" in whatever follows the prefix and requires that occurrence to
// consume the rest of the path outright (path.go's getMatch refuses a
// leftover detection path on this non-Use route), so a second ".ics" further
// right — "a.ics.ics" — is refused even though the string still ends in
// ".ics". Verified experimentally against a probe registering this exact
// route pattern under the shipped fiberConfig, not assumed from fiber's docs
// (see cmd/ovumcy's route-shape definition test for calendarFeedRoutePath):
// the token may contain any character but "/", must be non-empty, and the
// prefix/suffix match case-insensitively.
