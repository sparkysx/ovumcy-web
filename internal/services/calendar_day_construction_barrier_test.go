// Barrier for the calendar-day-as-instant class (issue #48 family).
//
// A value whose meaning is a CALENDAR DAY has exactly one safe shape in this
// tree: it is built through the package's single construction point
// (StartOfCalendarDay, reached via CalendarDay / DateAtLocation / ParseDayDate)
// and it is ordered against another calendar day through CalendarDaysBetween.
// Every instance of the class came from one of two shapes:
//
//	(a) a calendar day built directly as an instant in a non-UTC location —
//	    time.Date(..., location) or time.ParseInLocation — outside that
//	    construction point, so a zone whose midnight does not exist normalizes
//	    the value into the PREVIOUS day; and
//	(b) a raw Before/After/Equal/Sub between a value anchored at a location
//	    midnight and a value anchored at UTC midnight — the two name the same
//	    calendar day but are different instants, so the comparison misreads it
//	    every day, in every non-UTC zone, with no DST transition involved.
//
// The sweep below reads the shipped source rather than a list of known sites,
// so a site added later is covered the moment it is written. What it cannot see
// is stated on calendarDayBarrierBlindSpots and repeated in the failure text:
// shape (b) is decided from LOCAL variables inside one function only. An anchor
// that arrives as a parameter, a struct field or another package's return value
// is invisible to it, which is the deliberate trade — a barrier that guessed at
// those would flag safe code and be switched off.
//
// calendarDayBarrierAllowlist is the visible "still to do" list. Adding a line
// to it is a deliberate act and owes a reason, not a path.

// anchorClass is the midnight shape a value carries: which instant a calendar
// day was pinned to. Comparing two known-and-different classes is the defect.
