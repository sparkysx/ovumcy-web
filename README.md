Ovumcy is a menstrual cycle tracker you run on your own server. If the thought of your period dates, symptoms, and fertile-window estimates sitting on someone else's cloud makes you uneasy, this is for you: quick daily logging, cycle insights that are actually useful, and health data that stays on a machine you control.

Ovumcy runs as a single Go service with a server-rendered web UI, can be installed on a phone home screen, and supports SQLite by default with Postgres as an advanced self-hosted path.

This README describes the current `main` branch. The latest tagged release is `v1.9.2`.
The public project site is [ovumcy.com](https://ovumcy.com).

## Why Ovumcy Exists

Most cycle tracking apps start by asking you to sign up for a cloud account, then lean on analytics and third-party services you never really see.

Ovumcy goes the other way. You host it yourself, so the sensitive parts — your cycle history, your symptoms — stay with you. In return you get simple daily tracking and cycle insights that genuinely help, without handing your health data to anyone.

## How Ovumcy Is Different

Different trackers optimize for different things. The table below compares broad product models rather than specific brands, since privacy, export, and telemetry policies shift too often between apps to pin to names.

| Capability | Ovumcy | Local-first app | Cloud-first tracker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Self-hosted by the user or operator | :white_check_mark: | Device-local | :x: |
| No vendor account required | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :x: |
| Multi-device browser access | :white_check_mark: | :x: | :white_check_mark: |
| No telemetry or ad trackers by product default | :white_check_mark: | Varies | Varies |
| Open data export | :white_check_mark: | Varies | Varies |
| Operator-controlled storage | :white_check_mark: | Device-only | :x: |

Ovumcy trades single-device simplicity for self-hosted control, operator-managed storage, and browser access from any device.

## Short FAQ

### Does Ovumcy require a cloud account?

No — you run it yourself, on your own server, with no vendor account in the middle.

### Where is the data stored?

On the server you deploy Ovumcy to. SQLite is the default and works out of the box; PostgreSQL is there when you want it for a more involved setup. Nothing leaves that server unless you switch it on yourself: the optional webhook reminders POST the predicted dates to a URL you choose, and a calendar app you subscribe to the `.ics` feed fetches those dates wherever it runs — onto Google's or Apple's servers if that is where your calendar lives.

### Does Ovumcy use analytics or ad trackers?

No. No analytics, no ad trackers, no telemetry baked in.

### Can I export my data?

Yes, and easily. Export to CSV or JSON whenever you like, so your records are always yours to take elsewhere. See [docs/export.md](docs/export.md) for the exact JSON shape, CSV columns, and stability contract.

### Is there an HTTP API specification?

Yes. The canonical JSON surface lives at `/api/v1/*` and is described in [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml) (OpenAPI 3.1). `/api/v1/*` is the stable contract for external clients and wrappers — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the API Stability Contract. Building a wrapper? Start with `GET /api/v1/users/current` to confirm the session subject, then branch on the documented status code plus `error_detail.category` for error handling.

### Do I need technical knowledge to install Ovumcy?

Not much. If you're comfortable with the basics of Docker, the quick start will get you there — the repository ships a `docker-compose.yml` with working defaults, so you're not starting from a blank page.

### Is Ovumcy a medical product?

No. Ovumcy provides estimates and logs based on recorded data. It is not a medical device and should not be treated as diagnostic or treatment advice.

Period and fertile-window predictions in particular are statistical estimates derived from the cycle data you log. They are not a contraceptive method, a fertility treatment, or a substitute for medical care. Use a medically appropriate method when you need one.

## Features

- Log the day-to-day: period days, flow intensity, symptoms, and free-form notes.
- Your own custom symptoms — create, rename, hide, or restore them, and past entries stay intact through all of it.
- Predictions for your next period, ovulation, fertile window, and cycle phase.
- Calendar and statistics views for spotting patterns over the longer term.
- Reminders, three ways: an in-app dashboard banner, webhook reminders to your own self-hosted ntfy/Gotify endpoint, and a private, read-only calendar (`.ics`) subscription.
- Install it to your phone's home screen — a web app manifest and install prompt, no service worker or offline cache.
- CSV and JSON export — for backups, for moving your data, or just for looking back.
- Optional OIDC sign-in in hybrid or SSO-only mode, with guarded owner auto-provision and provider logout.
- Optional TOTP two-factor authentication for owner sign-in, working with any RFC 6238 authenticator app (Google Authenticator, 1Password, Aegis, and the like).
- Speaks English, Russian, Spanish, French, German, and Italian.
- Runs self-hosted, either via Docker or as a single Go binary.

## How Predictions Work

Ovumcy works out ovulation, the fertile window, and your next period from the
dates you log. There are no sensors and no hormone readings involved; it is
calendar math, and the model is deliberately simple:

- Your next period is your last period start plus your typical cycle length (the
  median of your recent cycles).
- Ovulation is counted back from there. The luteal phase, from ovulation to the
  next period, is treated as about 14 days by default — and refined toward your
  own value when your temperature or cervical-mucus entries allow — so ovulation
  lands near cycle length minus the luteal length.
- The fertile window is the six days ending on ovulation day, since sperm can
  survive a few days and the egg about one.

These are estimates, not medical advice and not a form of contraception, and they
get less reliable for irregular cycles.

The full algorithm, with every constant and edge case, is in
[docs/cycle-prediction.md](docs/cycle-prediction.md). The worked examples there are
checked by reference tests, so the doc and the code stay in sync. You can read how
a prediction is made and check it against the numbers yourself.

## Reminders & Notifications

Ovumcy can surface an upcoming period or ovulation estimate through three self-hosted channels, all driven by the same prediction and the same owner-configurable lead time:

- **In-app dashboard banner** — shown automatically; the owner sets how many days ahead it appears (0–14, default 3) from Settings.
- **Webhook reminders** — the owner points Settings at their own webhook endpoint (a self-hosted ntfy, Gotify, or similar instance); delivery runs via the `ovumcy notify` CLI on your own schedule (cron, systemd timer, Docker one-shot, Task Scheduler) or an optional built-in daily scheduler, off by default (`REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`).
- **Calendar (.ics) subscription** — the owner generates a private, read-only subscribe URL from Settings, shown once, for any calendar app that supports "subscribe by URL."

Every reminder — banner, webhook payload, and calendar feed alike — carries the same medical-safety framing as the rest of the app: these are estimates, not medical advice or a method of contraception.

Full setup steps, exact environment variables, and the CLI reference are in [docs/notifications.md](docs/notifications.md).

## Supported Languages

| Language | Code | UI support | `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| English | `en` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |
| Russian | `ru` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |
| Spanish | `es` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |
| French | `fr` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |
| German | `de` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |
| Italian | `it` | Full first-party UI localization | Supported |

These are the currently supported first-party UI languages. Operators can set `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` to any of the codes above, and users can switch language from the UI without changing deployment defaults.

## Privacy and Security

- No analytics, ad trackers, or remote telemetry.
- No telemetry and no outbound network calls in the default configuration. Outbound traffic only happens when an owner opts into it: the server talks to the configured identity provider when OIDC is enabled, and to the owner's own webhook endpoint when webhook reminders are configured. Nothing is ever sent to the Ovumcy project, and no egress happens that the owner did not configure; see [docs/security/data-handling.md](docs/security/data-handling.md) for the canonical egress statement.
- First-party cookies only; see [docs/security/cryptography.md](docs/security/cryptography.md#cookies) for the full inventory and attributes.
- Data stays on infrastructure you control.
- Automated security checks cover CodeQL, gosec, Trivy filesystem/container scans, and CycloneDX SBOM generation in GitHub Actions.
- SQLite is the baseline default; Postgres is available for advanced self-hosted deployments through official example stacks.
- Optional TOTP 2FA: secrets are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest with per-row aad binding, the login challenge and disable-confirmation endpoints are rate-limited, and each account carries a persistent monotonic replay floor (`totp_last_used_step`): a code at or below the last successfully consumed RFC 6238 step is rejected permanently, and the floor survives restarts.

Operator-facing GDPR compliance walkthrough lives in [docs/gdpr.md](docs/gdpr.md) (lawful basis, encryption-at-rest guidance, DSAR via export, breach notification runbook). The repo-visible security invariants live in [docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md](docs/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md); the GDPR cross-reference table is in [SECURITY.md → GDPR Cross-Reference](SECURITY.md#gdpr-cross-reference).

If you found a security issue, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Clients And Deployment Models

Ovumcy now has two public product shapes:

- [`ovumcy-web`](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web) is the self-hosted all-in-one web application and server in this repository.
- [`ovumcy-app`](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-app) is the local-first mobile client for iOS and Android.

For the mobile client, optional self-hosted encrypted sync is provided by [`ovumcy-sync-community`](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-sync-community).

In other words:

- choose `ovumcy-web` when you want one self-hosted server with a browser UI;
- choose `ovumcy-app` when you want an on-device local-first mobile experience;
- add `ovumcy-sync-community` only when the mobile app needs self-hosted encrypted backup, restore, or multi-device sync.

- `Browser UI`: server-rendered HTML with HTMX and plain JavaScript, plus mobile home-screen install support.
- `Go application`: a single service that handles routing, templates, i18n, and domain logic.
- `Storage`: SQLite is the baseline default; Postgres is an advanced self-hosted option.
- `Deployment`: one binary or container, typically behind a reverse proxy.

For the internal layering, trust boundaries, and request lifecycle, see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Go, Fiber, GORM.
- Frontend: server-rendered HTML templates, HTMX, plain JavaScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Storage: SQLite (baseline) or Postgres (advanced self-hosted).
- Deployment: Docker or direct binary execution.

## Quick Start

### Docker

Uses the prebuilt image from GHCR pinned to the latest tagged release by default (`ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2`).

Tagged releases from `v0.7.1` onward publish under the GHCR namespace `ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web`.

The same image is mirrored to Docker Hub as `docker.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web`, under the same tags and
at the same digest: the mirror is a copy of the signed manifest, not a second build. Substitute that
name into any command below to pull or verify what Docker Hub serves. The mirror is signed on Docker
Hub itself, by the same workflow identity and over that same digest, and the build provenance is
issued against the digest rather than against a registry — so both registries answer to the same
checks, and the release workflow refuses to report a mirror published until it has run the signature
check below against Docker Hub.

**Verify the image before running (recommended).** Every published image is Cosign-signed (keyless, via GitHub Actions OIDC — no long-lived signing key), carries a SLSA build-provenance attestation, and ships an SBOM attached at build time. To verify a tagged release (needs [`cosign`](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/) and the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) CLI):

```bash
# 1. Cosign signature — pins the signer identity (this workflow) and the OIDC issuer
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github\.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/\.github/workflows/docker-image\.yml@refs/tags/v' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2

# 2. SLSA build provenance (GitHub attestation)
gh attestation verify oci://ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2 --repo ovumcy/ovumcy-web

# 3. SBOM attached at build time
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2 --format '{{ json .SBOM }}'
```

**An untagged, unsigned digest can exist in the GHCR package, and it is safe to ignore.** The release workflow pushes the image by digest, scans every platform, and only then signs and tags it. When the scan refuses, or a step between the push and the signature fails, that digest stays in the public package: no tag, no signature, still pullable by digest, and printed in the failed run's log. Nothing you are told to run resolves to it — every command above names a tag, every tag the workflow writes points at a signed digest, and the Cosign check in step 1 fails on a digest that was never signed. It is kept rather than deleted on purpose: deleting it would need delete rights over the whole package inside the publish job — a `delete:packages` token, or the Admin role for this repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` on the package — and either would let a compromised publish step delete signed releases too, a larger risk than an unsigned digest that verification already refuses.

For public GHCR images, pull does not require GitHub login. `docker compose up -d` is enough because `pull_policy: always` is enabled.

```bash
mkdir -p ovumcy && cd ovumcy
curl -fsSL -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/main/.env.example
# set SECRET_KEY in .env, or mount a secret file and set SECRET_KEY_FILE
docker compose up -d
```

Override the pinned default image tag if needed:

```bash
OVUMCY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2 docker compose up -d
```

The `v1.9.2` tag is mutable and `pull_policy: always` re-pulls it on every restart, so a one-time Cosign/SLSA check does not by itself guarantee later restarts run the same bytes. To pin the exact image you verified above, set `OVUMCY_IMAGE` to its digest instead of the tag:

```bash
# Resolve the digest of the tag you just verified, then pin it in .env:
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web:v1.9.2 --format '{{ .Manifest.Digest }}'
# .env → OVUMCY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/ovumcy/ovumcy-web@sha256:<digest>
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

The base compose file now binds to loopback by default. For an intentional LAN/private-network bind, set `HOST_BIND_ADDRESS` in `.env` to a specific private IP you control before starting the stack. Only compose reads `HOST_BIND_ADDRESS`; the [Manual](#manual) path below ignores it.

**Upgrading an existing install to v2.0.0 or later: take the new compose file first.** Changing only `OVUMCY_IMAGE` on a compose file from v1.9.2 or earlier starts the new image without the `ovumcy_fence` volume it expects at `/app/fence`. The container still reports healthy, but the calendar-feed restore fence has nowhere to keep its marker, so every armed calendar feed is disarmed on every start, and `ovumcy reset-password` and `ovumcy users delete` refuse. Download the new `docker-compose.yml` (or the compose file of the example stack you run), or add the volume by hand: `- ovumcy_fence:/app/fence` under the service's `volumes:` (a postgres example stack has no such key on the app service yet, so add it) and an `ovumcy_fence:` entry under the top-level `volumes:`. The example stacks also forward settings an older copy leaves out, `REGISTRATION_MODE` among them, so an old stack ignores those values in `.env` until its compose file is replaced, and a value `.env` already holds for one of them takes effect at the first start of the new file: `REGISTRATION_MODE`, `HSTS_ENABLED`, `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` and `WEBHOOK_BLOCK_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES` refuse to start the app on a value they cannot read, so review `.env` for these keys before upgrading. The full sequence is in the [Safe Upgrade Procedure](docs/self-hosted.md#safe-upgrade-procedure).

For production-style setups:

- use the dedicated reverse-proxy examples from [docs/self-hosted.md](docs/self-hosted.md) instead of exposing `8080` directly;
- use [docs/examples/postgres/docker-compose.yml](docs/examples/postgres/docker-compose.yml) together with [docs/examples/postgres/.env.example](docs/examples/postgres/.env.example) for the official local/private Postgres path;
- choose one storage engine per deployment, because there is no automatic SQLite-to-Postgres migration tool yet.

### Manual

A binary started this way listens on `PORT` (default `8080`) on every interface; `HOST_BIND_ADDRESS` has no effect outside compose. On a machine other hosts can reach, block the port with a firewall.

Requirements:

- Go 1.27.1+
- Node.js 22+

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web.git
cd ovumcy-web
npm ci
npm run build
export SECRET_KEY="$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")"
go run ./cmd/ovumcy
```

Or keep the secret in a readable file and point `SECRET_KEY_FILE` at that path:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY_FILE=/absolute/path/to/ovumcy-secret.txt
go run ./cmd/ovumcy
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SECRET_KEY = node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
go run ./cmd/ovumcy
```

```powershell
$env:SECRET_KEY_FILE = "C:\\path\\to\\ovumcy-secret.txt"
go run ./cmd/ovumcy
```

## Configuration

Most self-hosted setups only need a small set of variables:

```env

Important notes:

- Always set a strong secret through `SECRET_KEY` or `SECRET_KEY_FILE`.
- `SECRET_KEY_FILE` must point to a readable file path for the running process. In Docker-based deployments, that means a path inside the container after you mount the file.
- `SECRET_KEY` takes precedence if both `SECRET_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY_FILE` are set.
- `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` supports `en`, `ru`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, and `it`.
- `REGISTRATION_MODE` supports `open` and `closed`; use `closed` for pre-provisioned or otherwise operator-restricted internet-facing instances where self-service sign-up must stay disabled.
- `HOST_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1` keeps the base compose path local/private by default. Only change it deliberately for a specific private-network bind. It is a compose setting, not an app setting: the binary ignores it and listens on `PORT` on every interface.
- Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when serving over HTTPS.
- `AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED` is off by default. Per-action security-event lines are suppressed; Go panics, startup errors, and the Fiber request log stay enabled. Flip to `true` only when investigating a specific incident, and remember the resulting stream contains `user_id` and is as sensitive as the database. See [docs/security/logging.md](docs/security/logging.md#logging-policy).
- OIDC sign-in is optional, supports `hybrid` and `oidc_only` login modes, and requires HTTPS plus `COOKIE_SECURE=true`.
- `OIDC_CA_FILE` is optional and lets Ovumcy trust a readable PEM CA bundle for private or internal identity-provider certificates.
- The first OIDC sign-in uses an existing `(issuer, subject)` link when present; a verified email claim that matches an existing local account does **not** link automatically — the callback refuses and redirects to `/login`. Completing the link needs the account's current password to start a Settings step-up and a fresh re-authentication at the provider, or the operator CLI for an account with no working sign-in — see [docs/oidc.md](docs/oidc.md#current-contract).
- `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION=true` is supported only with `REGISTRATION_MODE=open`; it creates `owner` accounts and can be restricted with `OIDC_AUTO_PROVISION_ALLOWED_DOMAINS`.
- Auto-provisioned users start without a local password. They can set one later in `Settings` to enable recovery codes and password-confirmed danger-zone actions.
- `OIDC_LOGOUT_MODE` controls whether logout stays local or redirects to the provider when discovery metadata includes `end_session_endpoint`.
- [docs/oidc.md](docs/oidc.md) includes a provider compatibility matrix: local-test-stack-verified support for Keycloak, authentik, and Authelia; Pocket ID 2.7.0+ reported-supported pending Ovumcy re-verification; query-only providers (Dex, better-auth, older Pocket ID) supported via `OIDC_RESPONSE_MODE=query`; and ZITADEL deployment requirements for browser sign-in. The matrix carries a "Last verified in" Ovumcy release column — see the doc for the test-stack scope and re-verification responsibility.
- Enable `TRUST_PROXY_ENABLED` only when running behind a trusted reverse proxy.
- SQLite is the supported baseline default; Postgres is an advanced self-hosted path that requires `DATABASE_URL`.
- Keep database storage persistent, whether that is a SQLite volume/bind mount or operator-managed Postgres storage.
- Full deployment, backup, reverse-proxy, and Postgres guidance lives in [docs/self-hosted.md](docs/self-hosted.md).

For deployment paths, reverse-proxy examples, backups, restores, and advanced Postgres setups, see [docs/self-hosted.md](docs/self-hosted.md). For provider-specific OIDC/SSO setup, see [docs/oidc.md](docs/oidc.md).

## Operator CLI

For self-hosted operators, the binary includes a small local-only CLI for account provisioning, audit, removal, and emergency password reset:

```bash
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users create owner@example.com
printf '%s' "$OWNER_PASSWORD" | go run ./cmd/ovumcy users create owner@example.com
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users list
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users delete owner@example.com
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users delete owner@example.com --yes
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users delete --id 7
go run ./cmd/ovumcy users set-email --id 7 owner@example.com
go run ./cmd/ovumcy reset-password owner@example.com
go run ./cmd/ovumcy reset-password --id 7
go run ./cmd/ovumcy repair symptom-names
```

Notes:

- `users create <email>` provisions an owner account so an instance can be set up declaratively — an install script, for example — instead of opening registration, signing up, then closing it again. Specifics worth knowing:
  - *Several owners per instance.* Run it once per person (household self-hosting); each owner's data stays isolated by `user_id`, and only a duplicate email is rejected. `--skip-if-exists` makes re-runs idempotent: an existing email is skipped with a success exit code, never overwritten. To change a password, use `reset-password`.
  - *The password never touches argv or the environment.* On an interactive terminal it prompts twice with echo disabled; when stdin is piped or redirected it reads the password from the first line of stdin.
  - *No recovery code is printed by default*, so it cannot leak into install logs. Pass `--show-recovery-code` to print it for an interactive operator, or sign in and regenerate one from Settings.
  - *No health data passes through provisioning.* Each owner completes onboarding — last period start, cycle defaults — on first sign-in.
- `users list` prints a minimal account audit table: `id`, `email`, `role`, `display name`, onboarding state, and creation time.
- `users delete <email>|--id <id>` removes the selected account together with related health data and prompts for an explicit `DELETE` confirmation — quoting the stored address, id and role — unless `--yes` is provided. An address matching more than one row is refused (naming the ids) instead of deleting whichever row a lookup returns first; retry with `--id`.
- `users set-email --id <id> <email>` re-homes one account to a new address, addressed by the id `users list` prints. It is the repair for an account whose stored email predates strict sign-in normalization and can therefore no longer be signed in to or addressed by email at all; it validates the new address under the same rule sign-in uses, refuses one another account already answers to, leaves the health record untouched, and bumps `auth_session_version` because the address is the login identity. Runbook: [docs/self-hosted.md](docs/self-hosted.md#an-account-cannot-sign-in-after-upgrading-email-stored-in-a-legacy-form).
- `reset-password <email>|--id <id>` prompts for a new password interactively, validates it against the password policy, writes its bcrypt hash to the account, and atomically bumps `auth_session_version` so every existing session is invalidated. Use this when an owner has lost both their password and their recovery code. Takes the same `--id` form as `users delete` and `users set-email`, for the same reason: a legacy row whose stored email predates strict sign-in normalization cannot be reached by address at all, and a bare address that matches more than one row is refused — naming the ids — rather than resetting whichever one the database happened to return first.
- `notify` runs one webhook reminder pass — decides due period/ovulation reminders per owner and delivers them to each owner's configured webhook. It is meant to be scheduled (cron, systemd timer, a Docker one-shot, or Task Scheduler), not run continuously; an optional built-in daily scheduler (`REMINDER_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`) can run the same pass in-process instead. See [docs/notifications.md](docs/notifications.md) for all three reminder channels (in-app banner, webhook, calendar feed), scheduling recipes, and the idempotency/security contract.
- `webhook show|set <email>` inspects or configures an owner's webhook notification settings (endpoint, enabled state, notify-period/notify-ovulation toggles) from the shell — the same settings the Settings-page form writes. See [docs/notifications.md](docs/notifications.md) for the full flag reference. `webhook` has no `--id` form; an address matching more than one row is refused (naming the ids) rather than configuring whichever row a lookup returns first.
- `repair` lists the offline data repairs the binary carries; each inspects and reports by default and changes nothing until `--apply`. Unlike every other subcommand it opens the database *without* applying migrations, because it exists for the case where a migration is refusing to run against data it cannot cover — which also stops the server, so there is no application to fix the data in. Today it carries one repair, `symptom-names`, for an account holding two symptoms under the same name. Runbook: [docs/self-hosted.md](docs/self-hosted.md#duplicate-rows-that-refuse-a-migration).
- Treat CLI usage as operator-only access. It is intended for local shell access on the instance, not for browser or remote public administration.

## Development

Common commands from the repository root:

```bash
# scoped past node_modules/, where a vendored JS dep ships a .go file;
# -timeout 30m raises Go's 10-minute PER PACKAGE default, which internal/api
# outruns on a dev host (see TESTING.md)
go test ./cmd/... ./internal/... ./migrations/... ./scripts/... ./web/... -timeout 30m
npm run build
go run ./cmd/ovumcy
```

Project structure:

- `cmd/ovumcy` - application entrypoint and runtime bootstrap
- `internal/api` - HTTP transport, handlers, and response mapping
- `internal/services` - domain logic
- `internal/db` - persistence and migrations
- `web/` - templates, JavaScript, and CSS assets

CI runs staticcheck, `go vet`, tests, and the frontend build on pull requests and on the merge queue's validation of the commit that lands.
The post-merge run on `main` deliberately skips that work — the queue already proved this exact commit — and executes only the work the queue does not: the cross-browser e2e, image-smoke and Postgres-smoke lanes, and the image publish.
Dedicated security workflows run CodeQL plus `gosec`, `govulncheck`, Trivy filesystem/container scanning, and publish a CycloneDX image SBOM artifact for each scan run.

Beyond plain unit and integration tests, the suite uses property-based tests,
native fuzzing, reference-vector tests for the cycle math, and mutation testing to
verify the tests themselves catch real bugs. See **[TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** for
the full quality and security approach.
