# Threat Model

_Part of the [Ovumcy security policy](../../SECURITY.md)._

## Threat Model

**In scope** — Ovumcy actively defends against:

- Credential stuffing and bot enumeration against `/api/v1/sessions`, `/api/v1/users`, and `/api/v1/password-resets` (rate limits, sealed pickup, bcrypt-timing equalization).
- Replay of captured sealed cookies (server-side single-use for register pickup; session-version checks for `ovumcy_auth`).
- DOM-XSS into HTMX error responses (status-error fragment is parsed with `DOMParser` and rebuilt via `document.createElement` + `textContent`, never `innerHTML`).
- Cross-site form submission (CSRF middleware on every state-changing endpoint, which also matches the browser `Origin`/`Referer` against the app's own scheme and host). The OIDC callback is the single validation exemption and is covered instead by the sealed one-time state cookie: `state`, `nonce`, and the PKCE verifier are generated **by Ovumcy** (`crypto/rand`) and held HttpOnly, and the callback is refused unless the value the provider echoes back matches the sealed one. The provider never chooses them — that is the whole basis of the substitution defence.
- Algorithm-confusion attacks against ID tokens (asymmetric-algorithm allowlist; `HS*` and `none` are rejected even if the provider advertises them).
- Malicious OIDC discovery metadata redirecting the logout flow to attacker-controlled hosts (`end_session_endpoint` origin-pinned to the configured issuer, and re-pinned when the stored end-session state is read back, so a row written under an earlier issuer cannot send the `id_token_hint` elsewhere; the post-logout return address is taken from the current configuration, never from that row).
- Malicious OIDC discovery metadata sending the browser's sign-in to a look-alike page: `authorization_endpoint` is origin-pinned to the configured issuer the same way, so the authorize hop carrying `state`, `nonce` and `redirect_uri` can only go same-origin.
- Malicious OIDC discovery metadata redirecting the JWKS key fetch to attacker-controlled hosts (`jwks_uri` origin-pinned to the configured issuer, so token-signature keys are only fetched same-origin).
- Malicious OIDC discovery metadata redirecting the code exchange: `token_endpoint` is origin-pinned to the configured issuer the same way, so the server-side POST carrying the client secret and authorization code can only go same-origin.
- Redirect-based escape from those pins: the OIDC HTTP client itself refuses to follow any HTTP redirect that leaves the issuer origin, so the discovery, JWKS, and token-exchange requests (and the client secret and authorization code the exchange carries) cannot be steered off-origin by a redirecting response either.
- Memory exhaustion through an oversized OIDC response: every response the OIDC HTTP client reads — discovery, JWKS and the token exchange — is capped at 512 KiB of body and 64 KiB of headers, and an oversized one fails the request instead of being buffered whole or truncated into a document that still parses.
- Cross-account ciphertext substitution at the database layer (field encryption is AAD-bound to the row id).
- Trivial password reuse (8-character minimum with three required character classes).
- Account takeover via a malicious or sloppy upstream OIDC IdP asserting a verified email already held by a local-auth Ovumcy account — a fresh `(issuer, subject)` pair is never linked to that account on the strength of the email claim alone (`ErrOIDCLinkRequiresConfirmation`); the callback refuses and redirects to `/login`. The only two ways to complete the link are the authenticated Settings step-up (`POST /api/v1/users/current/oidc/link/step-up`: the account's current password, then a fresh interactive `prompt=login` re-authentication at the provider) and the operator CLI (`ovumcy link-oidc-identity`) for an account with no working sign-in. The public `/auth/oidc/link-confirm` route that used to authorise this with a password alone on an unauthenticated page was removed for good (WEB-77); issue #701 had already made it unreachable, since the callback never minted the pending-link cookie it needed. See *OIDC Account Linking*.

**Out of scope** — Ovumcy assumes the operator is trusted, and does not defend against:

- An operator who reads the SQLite file directly, captures `SECRET_KEY`, or inspects process memory. The deployment model is single-tenant self-hosting; in the typical case the operator is the same person as the user.
- Compromise of the user's endpoint (browser malware, OS keyloggers, shoulder surfing).
- TLS downgrade attacks against an operator who runs the app over plain HTTP and ignores the `COOKIE_SECURE` advisory.
- Side-channel attacks against the host CPU (Spectre-class, cache-timing); Ovumcy uses constant-time comparisons where it matters but cannot defend the underlying hardware.
- Simultaneous compromise of `SECRET_KEY` and the OIDC provider's signing key.

Multi-tenant SaaS deployment, organizational identity management, hardware-key support, and audit-log compliance are not goals of this codebase. They are explicitly out of scope for both threat modeling and feature roadmap.
