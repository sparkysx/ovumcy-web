// advanceCalendarFeedFence is called by every write that changes which calendar
// feeds are armed. Where it sits relative to that write is decided by which
// mistake costs more, and the two cases genuinely differ:
//
//   - SaveCalendarFeedToken and ClearCalendarFeedToken advance FIRST. There the
//     write IS the revocation, and the rule is that the fence may never be
//     BEHIND the row state. Advancing after leaves a window in which the row
//     says revoked and the fence does not, and a restore across that window
//     revives the feed — the defect this whole mechanism exists for. Advancing
//     first cannot produce it: a crash in the window leaves the fence ahead of
//     a row that never changed, which is a still-armed feed and a revocation
//     the owner never saw succeed, so they retry it.
//
//     Note what this does NOT rest on. After an advance the two halves AGREE,
//     so no later boot disarms on its account; the safety comes from the
//     ordering itself, never from a boot-time backstop.
//
//     What it does not close is a backup taken INSIDE the window. The advance
//     and the row write are separate transactions, so a consistent snapshot
//     between them holds the new token beside a row that is still armed, and
//     restoring that snapshot compares equal and revives the feed. The window
//     is sub-millisecond and the runbook takes backups with the app stopped,
//     which is why it is named rather than engineered away; the reverse order
//     trades it for the strictly worse crash window described above.
//
//   - Everything else advances AFTER. There the feed clear is a side effect of
//     a credential rotation, a clear-data wipe or an erasure, and advancing
//     first would refuse the whole operation whenever the fence's own write
//     fails — a password change blocked by a calendar-feed marker. That trade
//     is not worth closing a window these paths only touch incidentally, and
//     their containment does not rest on the feed (the same statement bumps
//     auth_session_version). The window is named as a residual risk rather
//     than engineered away.
//
//     Every "advances AFTER" caller drops this call's error (`_ =`) rather
//     than returning it, because by the time it runs their own write has
//     already committed: reporting a completed password reset, recovery-code
//     rotation or clear-data as failed would be a bigger lie than the missing
//     fence record. The cost is bounded either way the fence can actually
//     fail — a write that moved the file but not app_state leaves the halves
//     disagreeing, and a write that moved neither leaves the fence unanchored
//     — and Enforce answers both by disarming every armed feed on the next
//     boot, never by losing a revocation silently. This reasoning is the
//     server's own; it holds only for a write acting on the account's OWN
//     feed, never for the operator CLI acting on someone else's, which is why
//     AdvanceConfirmed (internal/services) exists and refuses instead of
//     degrading.
//
// Deliberately NOT called by the two boot-time bulk disarms: the restore fence
// records its own token immediately after its disarm, and the key-rotation
// sentinel's disarm is answered by the key epoch, which a restore brings back
// together with the rows it belongs to. Nor by BackfillCalendarFeedVerifierMAC,
// which neither grants nor removes access — it rewrites a derived column for a
// token that already verified, on a read path taken by every first poll.

// The cost, stated at its worst rather than its typical: an in-flight pass loses

//
// The claim IS the watermark write — there is no second, separate advance after
// delivery. Writing it first is what makes the notify pass safe against overlap:
// the scheduler goroutine and an operator `ovumcy notify` process both compute
// their due-set from a record snapshot, so both can see the same uncovered
// anchor. An unconditional write let both deliver; a conditional one cannot.
//
// The UPDATE is a compare-and-set on the value the caller EXPECTS TO REPLACE —
// previous, the watermark this pass's own record snapshot carried — not on the
// value it is about to write:
//
//   - id = ? scopes the write to one owner, never another row.
//   - "column IS NULL" (previous nil) or "column = previous" is "the column has
//     not moved since I read it". Anything else means another writer got there
//     first, so this pass's due-set was computed against a watermark that no
//     longer exists and its conclusion cannot be trusted.
//
// Keying on the ANCHOR instead ("column <> anchor") is the tempting shorter form
// and it is wrong in one direction that matters: a pass holding a stale snapshot
// would win the claim over a NEWER watermark and move the column BACKWARDS. Its
// own delivery would announce a superseded cycle, and — because the column then
// no longer covers the newer anchor — the newer reminder would ship a second time
// on the next pass. The stale pass must lose. Regression:
// TestClaimWebhookWatermarkIsLostWhenTheColumnMovedSinceTheSnapshot.
//
// The next cycle stays claimable, which is the whole point of comparing against
// previous rather than against a fixed value: a pass that read watermark W and
// decided anchor X is due passes previous=W and wins, moving W to X.
//
// A nil or zero previous expects SQL NULL. A stored zero timestamp is a value
// nothing in this code path writes; were one to exist, every claim against it
// would be lost and the reminder suppressed — the fail-closed direction for an
// egress path, and never a duplicate send.
//
// Exactly one concurrent caller can see one row affected, because the conditional
// UPDATE is evaluated under the row lock: whichever statement runs second reads
// the column the first one already set. Zero rows is a normal outcome, not an
// error — the caller skips the send instead of duplicating it. Same shape as the
// TOTP replay guard's "totp_last_used_step < ?" below.
//
// The watermark alone is NOT the whole predicate, because it cannot see a
// revocation. configVersion is the webhook_config_version the same snapshot
// carried, and it is pinned too: every write to an owner's webhook configuration
// — a settings save, a disable, an endpoint replacement or removal, a change to
// the shared reminder lead window, a clear-data wipe — advances that column in
// the statement that performs it, so a claim presenting the previous epoch
// matches no row. That list is the complete set of writers, not an
// illustration: SaveWebhookSettings, UpdateReminderLeadDays and
// ClearAllDataAndResetSettings are the three, and a later writer owes the same
// advance whenever it CHANGES that configuration — never merely because it
// touched the users row. MarkWebhookDelivered is the counter-example and must
// stay one: it records a delivery that already happened, and advancing there
// would lose this same pass's next claim. It covers WHETHER, WHERE and HOW
// EARLY delivery happens and deliberately not what the reminder would say — a
// cycle-data edit or a timezone capture moves the prediction, which is the
// watermark compare-and-set's own subject, not this column's.
//
// Without the epoch the two revocation
// shapes both survive the watermark check: a settings save deliberately leaves
// the watermarks untouched, so the stale snapshot's compare-and-set still holds,
// and a clear-data wipe NULLs them, which re-opens the first-ever-claim branch
// outright. Either way the pass would POST health data to an endpoint the owner
// had already been told was revoked. The epoch is what makes the constitution's
// "containment survives state transitions" true across this one.
//
// webhook_enabled and the kind's own opt-in are pinned as well, and the honest
// reason is narrower than it first reads: today no reachable path needs them.
// The notify pass returns before the claim for an owner whose snapshot says
// delivery is off, and every write that turns delivery off also advances the
// epoch, so both shapes are already refused a step earlier. They are here as
// this layer's own floor, against the two things that would bypass that step —
// a future caller of this method that does not make the pass's early return,
// and a path that writes those columns without advancing the epoch. An egress
// claim already reading the row is cheap to make state its whole condition and
// expensive to retrofit once something depends on it not doing so. Regression:
// TestClaimWebhookWatermarkIsRefusedWhileDeliveryIsDisabled,
// TestClaimWebhookWatermarkIsRefusedForAKindTheOwnerOptedOutOf.
//
// What this does NOT cover, stated plainly because it cannot be fixed here: a
// request already in flight. The claim precedes the POST, so a revocation that
