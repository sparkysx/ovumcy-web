		// never captured gets the instance zone, not the poller's cookies —

	// authenticates leaves contextLocationKey unset here; requestLocation

// rendered had no catalogue in its locals, so the shared status fragment fell
// back to the machine key and a rate-limited owner read "too_many_login_attempts"
// in all six languages.
//
// This deliberately does NOT run the whole middleware. Its timezone half can
// load a zoneinfo entry from a client-supplied name, which is precisely the
// per-request work a cap exists to bound — resolving it ahead of the limiter
// would hand a flood the cost the limiter was protecting. Language resolution
// is a cookie read plus one merge of the locale's catalogue over the default
// one (what LanguageMiddleware pays per request), and it runs only on a refusal.
