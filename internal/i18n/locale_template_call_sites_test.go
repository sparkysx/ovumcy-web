// The reverse of locale_reachability_test.go. That barrier asks whether the
// application still names each catalogue key; this one asks whether the
// catalogue still answers each key a shipped template renders. Both directions
// are needed, and neither implies the other: `settings.2fa.status_enabled_hint`
// was rendered by internal/templates/settings_2fa.html and defined by no
// catalogue at all, so it was invisible to key parity (nothing to compare
// across six files) and invisible to reachability (no catalogue key to call
// dead). Every account with TOTP enabled read the raw identifier under a
// correctly translated heading, in all six languages.
//
// The barrier is CALL-SITE scoped rather than literal scoped. A literal sweep
// answers "is this string a key somewhere", which is exactly the question that
// cannot fail for a key that exists nowhere. Walking the parsed templates for
// commands whose function is `t` or `tn` and reading the argument in the key
// position is what makes an undefined key a finding.

// keyArgumentPositions names, per template func, the index in a command's
// argument list that carries the catalogue key. Index 0 is the function
// identifier itself, so these are the 1-based positions after it:
// `{{t .Messages "key"}}` and `{{tn .Messages .Language "key" .N}}`.
//
// The two entries mirror newTemplateFuncMap in
// internal/api/handlers_template_helpers.go. `tn` is listed even though no
// shipped template calls it today: a barrier that only understood the func
// currently in use would go quiet on the first template that reaches for the
// other one.

// templateKeyCallSite is one `t`/`tn` command found in a shipped template.
//
// keyIsLiteral separates the two cases deliberately. A key argument that is a
// pipeline, a `printf`, or a field is built at runtime and this barrier does
// not guess at it — the localeKeyFamilies registry in
// locale_reachability_test.go governs runtime-built keys from the other
// direction. A non-literal site still counts as a site, so it feeds the
// "did the sweep see anything at all" refusal below.
