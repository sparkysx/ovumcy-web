// Package publishgate holds the CI workflow's publish gate to a shape that an
// `if` carrying no status-check function cannot have.
//
// `publish-image` in .github/workflows/ci.yml is the only path by which
// `ghcr.io/<repo>:latest` follows `main`. It lists six jobs in `needs:` and
// carried an `if` naming only the event and the ref, with no status-check
// function in it. Six consecutive runs — 33217555948, 33213567903,
// 33188023148, 32905532451, 32882518209, 32853636750 — show it `skipped` with
// `started_at == completed_at` while all five of those jobs reported
// `success`, every lane beneath them skipped because `changes` clears
// `run_core` on `push` by design; and at `4b3c01d7` the registry's `latest`,
// `main` and `sha-3891c0f` all pointed at one index 242 commits behind `main`.
//
// That is the outcome and not the mechanism, and the mechanism is not settled
// here: an implicit `success()` ranging over the whole ancestor graph, and a
// skip propagating transitively past a gate that rescued only itself with
// `!cancelled()`, predict those six runs identically — as they do every other
// job shape this workflow currently has. ci.yml says the same where the gate
// lives, and says what to settle before a second gate is built on either
// reading. What the rules below need is narrower than that question and true
// under both answers: the condition must stop resting on an implicit predicate
// at all.
//
// Nothing reported that skip while it was happening. A skipped job is a
// satisfied check, and a tag that never appeared in a registry is not a signal
// any workflow reads, so the failure was silent by construction and stayed
// silent for 242 commits. This guard is the signal, and it holds the condition
// to four things at once — each one alone reads green over a gate the other
// three would catch:
//
//   - the status override, `!cancelled()`, which is what stops the condition
//     resting on the implicit predicate at all;
//   - an explicit `success` requirement per dependency, because `!cancelled()`
//     on its own publishes off a FAILED gate — read off the job's own `needs:`
//     list, so a sixth dependency added without a sixth clause fails here;
//   - no `||` beyond the two publishing events, because those requirements are
//     substrings and a substring survives being wrapped in one, which would
//     leave the check above green over a clause that gates on nothing;
//   - that `needs:` list itself against the five the gate was designed around,
//     since a dependency dropped from it also drops out of the check that reads
//     it.
//
// Each rule refuses a shape rather than approving one, so a condition this
// package cannot read is a failure and not a pass — including a respelled event
// disjunction, which is referred back to a reader instead of being guessed at.
// gateProblems is where all four live, away from the workflow they read, so
// they can be proven against conditions this repository does not contain.
