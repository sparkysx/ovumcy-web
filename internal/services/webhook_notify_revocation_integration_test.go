// Finding PRIV-1 / SEC-01, driven end to end: the REAL notify pass over the REAL
// user repository, with a revocation landing in the window the pass actually
// has — after it snapshotted the owner's configuration and before it claims the
// send.
//
// The unit tests either side of this one each hold half of the claim. The db
// cases prove the SQL predicate refuses a stale epoch; the service case proves
// the pass hands the claim the epoch its own snapshot carried. Neither can show
// what the two do together on a live engine, which is the thing the finding was
// about: an owner is told the revocation succeeded, and a pass already in flight
// still POSTs their predicted health data to the endpoint they just removed.
//
// The interleaving is deterministic, not raced. The log read is the pass's own
// seam between the snapshot and the claim, so performing the revocation there
// puts it exactly where a real one would land, with no goroutines and no timing
// assumption to go flaky.

// revokingLogReader serves one owner's day logs and performs a revocation the
// first time it is asked, so the pass is already holding its snapshot when the
// owner's configuration changes underneath it. revoke is called before the logs
// are returned, which models a pass that had already read everything it needs
// and is now on its way to the claim.
//
// The mutex follows this package's convention rather than a present need: the
// pass walks owners sequentially, so nothing races today, but every other
// mutating stub here (stubDeliverer, stubNotifyRepo) carries one, and a reader
// that did not would be the single spot a later concurrent case races on.
// internal/reminders drives genuinely overlapping passes, but through its own
// stubs — these are package-private to services and it never sees them.
