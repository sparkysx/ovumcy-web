// threading while doing exactly what the other two do — and a boot pass written
// with it would ignore its storage budget while looking correct.

// detachesFromTheCaller anywhere in this package's production files, and

// spelling the call check matches on would be an assumption rather than a
// property.
//
// It is the middle link of the chain the boot-pass storage budget rides on.
// cmd/ovumcy bounds each boot pass with a deadline and a guard there proves the
// pass RECEIVES it; internal/db proves a cancelled context aborts the query. A
// service in between that re-rooted its context would break the chain without
// breaking either of those tests: the deadline would never reach storage, a
// stuck database would hang the boot exactly as it did before the budget
// existed, and every test would stay green.
//
// The rule is not new, only unenforced here. Repositories already take a ctx
// parameter rather than rooting one at context.Background, and this package held
// to it on its own — the sweep found zero occurrences when it was written, which
// is why it can be an outright refusal rather than an allowlist. A service that
// genuinely needs a detached context (a goroutine outliving its request) has to
// say so here, and that is the point: it becomes a decision someone makes on
// purpose rather than a line that slips in.
