// Package workflowfile reads a GitHub Actions workflow the way the guards that
// judge one need it read: find the module root, read the file with its line
// endings normalised, cut one job out of it by name, read the shell a step
// declares for the harnesses that run that step's script, and find the runner
// keys (`if:`, `continue-on-error:`) that would let a gate step fail open —
// which no harness running the script can see.
//
// Three test packages assert something about a job declared under
// `.github/workflows` — publishgate holds ci.yml's `publish-image` gate to a
// condition that cannot read green over a skip, releasegate holds the release
// tag gate to the checks it claims to require, publishorder holds the publish
// job's steps to the order that keeps a public tag behind the signature — and
// each had carried its own copy of these three pieces.
//
// Three copies is three chances for one of them to start walking past a shape
// the other two still see, and every one of these guards fails in the same
// direction when its reader does: a job it cannot find is a job it does not
// judge, and the test reports green over exactly the defect it was written for.
// The copies are what makes that divergence possible, so there is one reader.
