// plainPageFormBackPath resolves the page a browser posted one of the in-app
// hx-post forms from when it did so without JavaScript: the onboarding steps,
// the manual cycle-start control, the day editors, the cycle settings and the
// settings forms for reminders, interface, tracking, symptoms, the account,
// the second factor, and the erasure and egress sections. A refusal there
// would otherwise paint the JSON envelope as the page, so apiError answers the
// localized message with a link back instead, as a page in the shared layout —
// same status, same key. No cookie rides on it, the flash included. The one refusal that is not
// answered as that page is a request with no session (isSignedOutRefusal): it
// is sent to /login with the sign-in notice in the flash.
//
// Scoped tighter than isPlainAuthFormPageNavigation: the request must also say
// it accepts text/html, because API clients post form bodies to these routes
// with no Accept header at all and keep the JSON envelope. A form that names a
// verb with its hidden _method field is routed as that verb before CSRF and
// the limiters run, so c.Method() is PUT, PATCH or DELETE by the time a refusal
// reaches here; arrivedAsOverriddenFormPost says that request was still a form
// POST, and a client sending the real verb is not one.
//
// The link is built from the route alone. The date is re-formatted from the
// parsed value and `source` only picks between two fixed pages, so nothing the
// request carries reaches the href verbatim.

//
// The page does not need a session and shows nothing of one: it renders with no
// CurrentUser, so the layout draws its signed-out header — no navigation, no
// account chip, no timezone script — whichever request reached here. The CSRF
// token the layout reads is the one the middleware already put in the context,
// if any; rendering mints none and sets no cookie. The rendered address is the
// back path, never the request's own: the request's path is the API route, which
// the language switch would send the browser to and the privacy link carry. That
// address goes through the same query allowlist as every other page's
// (currentPathWithQuery): on /lang the back path is the form's own `next`, so a
// cross-site post would otherwise put any query it likes into the switcher and
// the outgoing privacy link. The link back itself keeps the whole `next` — it is
// where a granted switch would have redirected.
//
// Should the page fail to render, the bare fragment carries the same refusal
// rather than a template error mapped back into this branch.
