// Seven validator sentences are carried twice: once under `onboarding.step2.`
// for the onboarding form and once under `settings.cycle.` for the cycle
// settings card. They are the same two validators reading the same two fields,
// their English text is identical to the character, and both surfaces render a
// plain template literal — so a wording change costs twelve edits and nothing
// reports a half-applied one. This class has already drifted once:
// `onboarding.step1.field` and `settings.cycle.last_period_start` agree in
// English and disagree in Italian ("ultimo ciclo" vs "ultimo periodo").
//
// The registry is EXPLICIT and short on purpose. "Same suffix under these two
// prefixes ⇒ same text" is not true as a rule: `onboarding.step2.auto_period_fill`
// ("Auto-mark period days") and `settings.cycle.auto_period_fill` ("Auto-fill
// period days") differ deliberately, as do `onboarding.step2.irregular_cycle`
// ("My cycle is usually irregular") and `settings.cycle.irregular_cycle` ("I
// have an irregular cycle") — a form label and a settings toggle addressing the
// reader differently. Widening this to a pattern would demand those be made
// identical, which is a copy regression dressed as consistency. Adding a suffix
// here is a claim that the two surfaces must say the same thing; make it
// deliberately.
