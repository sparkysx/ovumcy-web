// Barrier for the per-day symptom-id counting class.
//
// A day's SymptomIDs is a stored slice, and every surface that counts symptoms
// walks it once per day. A slice that repeated an id would count that day
// twice: the phase insights divide the count by the number of days in the
// phase, so a repeat renders a percentage above 100, and the frequency list and
// the picker's usage ranking are skewed the same way.
//
// ValidateSymptomIDs builds a unique map before persisting, so no stored slice
// repeats an id today. That is what makes this internal rather than a live
// defect — and it is exactly the shape this repository treats as a defect in
// its own right when it is fixed at some sites and not others: three read sites
// deduped and three not, with the deduped ones making the bare ones look
// deliberate. A second write path, an import, or a repaired row is all it takes
// for the bare sites to diverge from the deduped ones.
//
// So the class is closed at every site, and this barrier reads the shipped
// source to keep it closed: a new loop over a day's symptom ids that does not
// route through one of the two helpers fails here the moment it is written.
//
// Three properties keep the sweep honest, and each was added after the sweep
// was measured passing without it:
//
//   - an exemption clears ONE loop, not a whole function, and an exempted loop
//     that increments anything is itself an error — a counting loop added
//     beside the cleared one used to be unexamined;
//   - a single-assignment local is resolved back to the expression it was
//     assigned from, because `ids := logEntry.SymptomIDs` followed by
//     `range ids` is an everyday refactor and used to walk straight past;
//   - the violation matcher is anchored on fixture sources this test owns, one
//     that must be flagged and one that must not, because the real tree's six
//     compliant sites keep the "found something" counter above zero on their
//     own and would hide a matcher that had stopped matching.
//
// What it still cannot see, stated here and repeated in the failure text: a
// local assigned more than once, a slice handed to a helper of this package's
// own before being counted, an index loop rather than `range`, and any field
// not named SymptomIDs. Those are why the three SurvivesARepeatedID guards
// below exist beside it — the sweep is the barrier for sites added tomorrow,
// and it is not the only one for the sites that exist today.
