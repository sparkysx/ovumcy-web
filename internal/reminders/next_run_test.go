// — to 23:00 of the current day, i.e. before now. A single advance returned that
// past instant, untilNextRun went negative, the timer fired immediately and the
// loop recomputed the same negative delay: a full notify pass over every owner,
// repeated from local 23:00 until the transition.
//
// Advancing past such a day is not the answer either: that skips the day's pass
// for every owner, and a reminder due only on that day is then never delivered
// (nothing ran, so no watermark can compensate). The day resolves to its FIRST
// EXISTING INSTANT — the transition — which is the convention the rest of the
// tree already follows through services.StartOfCalendarDay.
