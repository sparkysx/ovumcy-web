// calendar_day_step_dst_test.go — a calendar-day STEP must not be taken inside
// the request zone.
//
// `day.AddDate(0, 0, n)` re-enters time.Date in the receiver's own location. In
// the UTC-minus zones whose DST jump lands on midnight (America/Santiago
// 2026-09-06, America/Havana 2026-03-08) that local midnight does not exist, so
// the missing wall clock resolves BACKWARD and the step returns the PREVIOUS
// calendar day at 23:00. Everything downstream that reads the calendar
// components — a map key, a rendered bound, a projected date — is then handed
// the wrong day.
//
// AddCalendarDays is the single stepping point that fixes it: it steps over
// UTC-anchored days and resolves the result back into the caller's location
// through StartOfCalendarDay. This file pins the helper itself and the
// user-visible surfaces that were stepping by hand.
//
// The zone must be west of UTC — east-of-UTC zones normalize a missing midnight
// forward and keep the date, so the same fixture there is green about nothing.
// Every case carries a UTC control.
