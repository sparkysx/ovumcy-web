// MethodOverride routes a browser form POST as the verb its hidden `_method`
// field names, so a settings form whose htmx attribute sends PUT or DELETE
// reaches the same handler when it is submitted without JavaScript.
//
// It acts only on a POST whose declared media type is
// application/x-www-form-urlencoded and that carries no Content-Encoding.
// Everything else passes through untouched: JSON and other bodies, multipart
// (no form in the app declares an enctype), every non-POST verb (htmx already
// sends the real one), and the query string, which is never read. The body is
// bound through the form binder before PostArgs is read: the binder folds
// a mixed-case Content-Type before fasthttp parses and caches the body, which a
// raw PostArgs call would cache as empty and hide csrf_token from CSRF. A body
// that provably names no such field is not bound at all; see
// methodOverrideBodyMayNameTheField.
//
// On a plain urlencoded body, a present field outside the allowlist, empty or
// repeated, is refused with a 400 instead of being ignored, so such a form never
// runs the POST action it did not ask for. That guarantee covers ONLY the plain
// urlencoded body. A multipart or Content-Encoded form POST is never inspected
// and runs as the POST it is, `_method` or not: reading either here would mean
// spooling multipart parts or decompressing ahead of the rate limiters and the
// body-limit guard, and refusing either on shape alone would refuse legitimate
// form POSTs that carry no `_method` (the auth handlers accept multipart, and
// requestBodyLimitGuard exists because compressed bodies are accepted). No form
// in the app can send either shape with an override: none declares an enctype,
// browsers never compress a form, and the templates guard fails on an
// overridden form that gains a multipart enctype.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING. The composition root mounts this with app.Use ahead of
// the rate limiters and CSRF, after only other app-wide Use middleware:
//   - CSRF and the method-scoped limiters read c.Method(), so they see the verb
//     the router will run: the token stays mandatory, and a DELETE-scoped
//     budget cannot be dodged by POSTing the same request with _method=DELETE;
//   - fiber resumes routing at the next index of the NEW method's route stack,
//     which is the right place only while every route registered before this
//     one is an app-wide Use present in every stack.
//
