# Mutation baseline — `internal/api`

Authoritative gremlins run for the transport/HTTP package. Reproduce with
`scripts/mutation.sh baseline` (per-package JSON lands in `.tmp/mutation/`); this
file is the reviewed summary committed alongside the code.

## v1.8.x exhaustive verification (2026-07-12)

Every survivor in the v1.8.0 baseline (`workflow_dispatch` run
[29168889008](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/29168889008) on
tag `v1.8.0`, `internal_api`: 743 mutants, 617 killed, 44 lived, 82 not covered)
was verified per-mutant on branch `test/mutation-hardening` — the exact gremlins
mutation applied, a **deliberately broad** covering test set run (not gremlins'
coverage-guided subset), then reverted. Production `.go` is unchanged (tests
only). The raw survivor list over-reports because Go emits no coverage counter on
`const`/`case` lines and gremlins' coverage-guided selection can miss the killing
test; most survivors were already-killed or equivalent, but several genuine gaps
surfaced and are now pinned:

- **Log-redaction of capability secrets (security):** the opaque-token
  character-class upper boundaries `char <= 'z'` / `<= 'Z'`
  (`request_logging.go` L155/L156) were unpinned — a base64url bearer token
  containing a boundary letter (including the `.ics` calendar-feed capability
  token) would fail `isOpaqueRequestLogSegment` and be logged **verbatim**.
- **Sealed-cookie TTLs:** the `flash` cookie (L12) and the one-time `.ics`
  feed-URL **secret** reveal cookie (`calendar_feed_reveal_cookie.go` L26) had no
  test pinning their expiry; a `* → /` mutation collapsed each to immediate
  expiry.
- OIDC logout-state persistence on a *successful* login (`handlers_auth_oidc.go`
  L122; only e2e-covered before); localized error/HTMX substitution and the
  not-found raw-i18n-key leak (`error_mapping_{transport,pages}.go`); the
  `Retry-After` back-off hint (`error_mapping_rate_limit.go` L58); authenticated
  `/privacy` nav (`privacy_page_helpers.go` L18); calendar-sourced cycle-start
  redirect (`handlers_days_write.go` L185); over-long symptom-draft echo
  (`handlers_days_symptoms.go` L90); and `currentUserOrUnauthorized`'s
  `handled` flag / latent nil-user deref (`page_request_helpers.go` L35).
- Wave 3 additionally pinned the stats-page chart summaries, export form-value
  preservation, timezone-cookie rewrite, and route-template log path.

**Two initially-flagged items, now resolved and pinned:**
`handlers_settings_danger.go` L75 — the `err != nil` operand negation (distinct
from the genuinely-equivalent `hasJSONBody` operand documented in
`settings_mutation_handlers_test.go`) breaks a valid **JSON-body erasure**, which
is a supported flow: `DELETE /api/v1/users/current` and
`POST /api/v1/users/current/data-wipe/validate` both accept `application/json`.
Pinned by `TestValidateClearDataPassword_JSONBodyWithCorrectPasswordSucceeds`
(valid password + CSRF + owner session must still succeed — the
re-auth-for-erasure invariant is upheld, not bypassed).
`handlers_days_write.go` L113 — the long-period-warning acknowledgement
(`feedbackErr == nil` guard) is pinned by
`TestUpsertDayPersistsLongPeriodWarningAcknowledgement`. No suspected bugs.

**Post-hardening re-measure.** A fresh clean-Linux run on the `test/mutation-hardening` branch ([29192052605](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/29192052605)) confirms the closed gaps: `internal_api` **97.3%** (649 killed / 18 lived, 76 not covered), up from 93.3% at the v1.8.0 baseline. Current canonical figure (mirrored in `TESTING.md`); the dated `## Score` sections below are prior runs, kept as history.

## Score (measured on `a6d7e41`)

A single unsharded CI run exceeds the job's 3h timeout before finishing (issue
#161), so `mutation.yml` runs `internal/api` as 5 file-subset shards
(`internal_api_1`..`internal_api_5` matrix entries, each excluding every file
not assigned to it — see `scripts/mutation.sh`'s `shard_*` functions) and a
follow-up job (`mutation-merge`) merges the 5 shard JSON reports into one
`internal_api.json` via `scripts/mutationmerge`, matching the single-file-per-target
convention `internal_services.json`/`internal_security.json` already use (PR
#163). The numbers below are the first complete run since sharding landed —
**workflow_dispatch run [28758365493](https://github.com/ovumcy/ovumcy-web/actions/runs/28758365493)**,
all 5 shards plus the merge job green — and are the combined total across all 5
shards, the same figure a hypothetical single unsharded run would have produced.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Killed | 488 |
| Lived (survivors) | 128 |
| Timed out | 0 |
| Not covered | 98 |
| Not viable | 0 |
| **Test efficacy** | **79.22%** — killed / (killed + lived) = 488 / 616 |
| Mutator coverage | 86.27% — (killed + lived) / (killed + lived + not covered) = 616 / 714 |

Per-shard breakdown (gremlins' own summary line for each matrix job; sums to the
combined row above):

| Shard | Killed | Lived | Not covered | Test efficacy | Mutator coverage |
|-------|--------|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| internal_api_1 | 77 | 29 | 19 | 72.64% | 84.80% |
| internal_api_2 | 111 | 21 | 6 | 84.09% | 95.65% |
| internal_api_3 | 93 | 8 | 9 | 92.08% | 91.82% |
| internal_api_4 | 115 | 52 | 46 | 68.86% | 78.40% |
| internal_api_5 | 92 | 18 | 18 | 83.64% | 85.94% |

## Survivors of the `a6d7e41` run — history, backlog closed

**Superseded, kept for the reasoning.** The section that follows records the state
at the `a6d7e41` run above. The exhaustive verification of 2026-07-12 triaged every
survivor of the later v1.8.0 baseline per-mutant, and the post-hardening re-measure
(**97.3%**, 18 lived) is the current canonical figure — so the follow-up this section
asks for has happened, and neither the 128 count nor the 79.22% describes the tree.

Unlike `internal-services.md`/`internal-security.md`, the 128 survivors here were
**not** individually triaged into "real gap" vs. "documented equivalent mutant"
at the time — that requires a source-level equivalence review per mutant (apply the
mutation, confirm no test fails, judge whether it's reachable), which is a
separate follow-up, not implied by getting real numbers out of CI for the first
time. Do not read the raw 79.22% efficacy as "21% of behavior is untested" —
some fraction of these are almost certainly equivalent mutants like the ones
already documented for `internal/services`/`internal/security`.

Survivor count by file, top entries (from the merged `internal_api.json`; full
list has 40 files with at least one survivor):

| File | Survivors |
|------|-----------|
| `stats_page_helpers.go` | 19 |
| `handlers_auth_token_helpers.go` | 10 |
| `request_logging.go` | 9 |
| `handlers_days_status_helpers.go` | 8 |
| `security_event_logging.go` | 7 |
| `handlers_template_ui_helpers.go` | 6 |
| `handlers_template_format_helpers.go` | 6 |
| `settings_symptom_view_models.go` | 5 |
| `i18n_helpers.go` | 5 |

The 98 not-covered mutants concentrate similarly: `request_logging.go` (35),
`request_timezone_policy.go` (16), and `asset_version.go` (15) account for two
thirds of them — worth checking whether these are dead code, tested only at the
integration/e2e layer (the `internal/security` OIDC precedent), or a genuine gap
before the next triage pass.
