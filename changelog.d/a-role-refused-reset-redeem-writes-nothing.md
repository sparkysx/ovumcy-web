Tests and a code comment only: a password-reset redeem for an account whose role cannot hold a web
session is refused as an invalid reset token before the password and recovery
code are rewritten, so the account never ends up with a freshly rotated recovery
code that nobody was shown. That ordering held, but no regression named it:
without the role check inside reset-token resolution, the redeem would rotate
both secrets before the session refusal that follows. A regression now proves
the refusal on the stored row for each of the three token purposes the redeem
accepts (recovery, forced-from-local, forced-from-OIDC), and anchors it with the
same token rewriting the row once the account is an owner again.
